<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>After my return from Newfoundland,
in the year 1791, I was
curious to look back into what had
been done, in former times, on the
subject upon which I had myself been
just employed. I accordingly looked
over the <span class="smcap">Newfoundland Entries</span>,
and the <span class="smcap">Newfoundland Bundles</span>
among the books which belonged to
the late board of trade; and I then
pursued the subject through the
<span class="smcap">Registers</span> of the present committee
of council for trade and plantations.</p>

<p>I was very much struck with the
matter and reflections furnished by
this research; and I wished that the
useful information, which I had derived
from this retrospect, might be seen
by those, who had at that time to
consider the subject of Newfoundland.
Hence arose the present History; and
as the same subject is now before the
House of Commons, I have ventured
to print it, and throw it among the
other materials under examination.</p>

<p>If this public enquiry had not been
instituted, the story here told would
have been confined to the circle for
which it was originally intended.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>I intend to give a short history of the
Government and Constitution of the island
of <i>Newfoundland</i>. This will comprise the
struggles and vicissitudes of two contending
interests.—The <i>planters</i> and <i>inhabitants</i>
on the one hand, who, being settled there,
needed the protection of a government and
police, with the administration of justice:
and the <i>adventurers</i> and <i>merchants</i> on the
other; who, originally carrying on the
fishery from this country, and visiting that
island only for the season, needed no such
protection for themselves, and had various
reasons for preventing its being afforded
to the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>This narrative will divide itself into four
periods, or parts. The <i>first</i> will close with
the passing of stat. 10 &amp; 11. Will. 3. c. 25.
by which the adventurers and merchants
were supposed to have obtained a preference,
and advantage over the pretensions
of the inhabitants, and planters. The
<i>second</i> will end with the appointment of a
civil governor, and of justices of the peace
in 1729; by which some stop was put to
the disorder and anarchy that had long
prevailed in the island, especially during
the winter seasons. This may be considered
as an advantage gained by the inhabitants
and planters. The <i>third</i> closes with
Stat. 15, Geo. 3. c. 31. commonly called in
the island <i>Sir Hugh Palliser’s act</i>, which was
intended for giving an advantage to the
fishery carried on from the mother country;
but, as it obliges both merchants and
planters to pay their servants’ wages, it
is equally abhorred by both parties; and
both parties have shewn great readiness to
join in asserting, that the fishery has gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
decayed ever since the passing of
this act. The <i>fourth</i> comes down to the
year 1791, when a court of civil jurisdiction
was established upon principles
which, it was thought, would secure the
impartial administration of justice to the
merchant and the planter, the rich, and
the poor, the master, and the fisherman.</p>

</div>


<div class="sidenote">Different Charters
granted.</div>

<p>Newfoundland, like other new
discovered lands in America, was endeavoured
to be settled, and improved by
means of charters granted from the crown;
it being hoped that individuals would, in
this manner, be tempted to pursue the
public advantage, through the medium
of their private interest. Charters were
granted at five different times. The first
was in 1578 to <i>Sir Humphry Gilbert</i>, who
had thereby full power given him to possess
all lands in Newfoundland not in actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
possession of any Christian prince.
By virtue of this authority, he, in 1583,
landed in <i>St. John’s Bay</i>, and we are told,
that calling together both English and
strangers then fishing, he took possession
of the country in the queen’s name, and
erected the arms of England upon a pillar
of wood, in testimony of her majesty’s
sovereignty.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> charter was granted in 1610
by <i>king James</i>, to the <i>Earl of Northampton</i>,
<i>Sir Francis Bacon</i>, and several others, by
the name of <i>the Treasurer and Company of</i>
<span class="smcap">Adventurers</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Planters</span> <i>of the City
of London and Bristol, for the Colony in Newfoundland</i>,
with all the usual prerogatives
and immunities; but in this grant there
was a reserve to all persons of an entire
liberty to fish.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> charter was granted to <i>Sir Geo.
Calvert</i> (the grantee of the province of
Maryland) and his heirs, of a tract of
land called <i>the Province of Avalon</i>, lying to
the south east point of the island, extending
between ports <i>Fermose</i> and <i>Aquafort</i> to
<i>Petty Harbor</i>, and from thence westward
to the bay of <i>Placentia</i>. There was also a
grant to him of the property of all islands
lying within ten leagues of the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
shore, together with the fishing of all
sorts of fish, saving to the English the free
liberty of fishing, salting, and drying of
fish.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> charter was granted in 1628,
to the <i>Marquis of Hamilton</i>, the <i>Earl of
Pembroke</i>, <i>Earl of Holland</i>, <i>Sir David Kirk</i>,
and others; and under pretence that Lord
Baltimore (the heir of Sir Geo. Calvert)
and other proprietors, had deserted the
plantation, this grant included the province
of <i>Avalon</i>. In this grant it was provided,
that no person should plant or inhabit
within six miles of the sea shore between
cape <i>Race</i> and cape <i>Bonavista</i>.</p>

<p>Thus far did the crown go in the granting
of four exclusive rights in Newfoundland.
But this detail gives us no information
as to the constitution and regulation
of the island, its trade and
fishery. On this head we find, that in
1615 Captain <i>Richard Whitburne</i> was sent
out with a commission from the high court
of admiralty, authorizing him to impannel
juries, and to make inquiry upon oath,
of sundry abuses, and disorders committed
every year, among the fishermen upon
that coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rules and regulations
of the
star-chamber.</div>

<p>In the year 1633, the star-chamber took
up the subject of the fishery:—a petition
and complaint had been there preferred by
the merchants and owners of ships in the
west of England: and that court, after
taking the same into consideration, was
pleased to issue the following order, for
better regulating the trade.</p>

<p>If a man killed another, or stole to the
value of forty shillings, the offender was
to be brought to England, and the matter
was to be tried by the Earl Marshal; and
if the fact was proved by two witnesses,
the offender was to suffer death.—No ballast
was to be thrown out of ships to the
prejudice of the harbours—no person was
to deface or spoil any stage, cook-room, or
other building—the ship that first entered
the harbour was to be admiral—no person
should deface or alter the marks of any boats,
to defraud the owners—no person was to
steal any fish, train, or salt, or other provision,
belonging to the fishing ships—no
person was to set fire to the woods, or rind
the trees, except for cook-rooms—none
were to cast anchor so as to hinder the
haling of seines—none should rob the nets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of any drift boats—no tavern should be set
up for the selling of wine, beer, strong water,
or tobacco—the company were to assemble
themselves on Sunday to hear divine service—the
mayors of <i>Southampton</i>, <i>Weymouth</i>,
and certain other towns, were to take
cognizance of all complaints made against
any offender upon land—the vice-admiral
in the counties of <i>Southampton</i>, <i>Dorset</i>,
<i>Devon</i>, and <i>Cornwall</i>, was to proceed against
offenders at sea.—These laws were to be in
force till they were annulled by his Majesty;
and the admiral in every harbour of the
island was to make proclamation of them.</p>

<p>On the 20th of February following, a
charter, being the <i>fifth</i>, was granted according
to the tenor of this order, made
by the star-chamber, to <i>the merchants and
traders to Newfoundland</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1650, the council of state
gave a commission to <i>John Treworgay</i>, merchant,
who was then in the island, <i>to order
affairs there for the best advantage of the state</i>;
which commission was renewed in 1653.
A commission was also obtained in 1655
by Sir <i>David Kirk</i> (who had been one of
the grantees in the charter of 1628), together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
with <i>John Claypole</i>, <i>John Goffe</i>, and
others; but it does not appear that any
thing was done thereupon.</p>

<p>After the restoration, <i>Lord Baltimore</i>, who
had been dispossessed of the province of
<i>Avalon</i>, by the charter granted to the Marquis
of Hamilton and others, obtained
orders in 1660, for a restitution of that
province. And there was also on the
24th January 1660 a renewal and confirmation
of the charter granted to the
merchants and traders in February 1633;
on which occasion this additional provision
was made: “That no master or owner
of any ship should transport any persons
to Newfoundland who were not of the
ship’s company, or such as were to
plant and settle there.”</p>

<p>In support of this last provision, a letter
was written on the 4th December 1663 by
the lords of the privy council, enjoining
the magistrates of the western ports to take
care that no owners of ships, trading to
Newfoundland, suffered any persons to be
transported thither, other than such as were
of the ship’s company, and <i>the officers of his
Majesty’s customs</i> in the several ports therein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
named directed, and to charge all masters
of ships to observe this rule. In the 15th
year of Charles II. the parliament made some
regulation respecting this trade and fishery.
By statute 15 Car. 2, c. 16, penalties are
imposed on planters and others, who destroy
the fry of fish, or burn or destroy
boats left in the harbour, or pull down
houses or stages built by the English to live
in during the fishing season; and no toll
is to be demanded for fish of English
catching.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of appointing a
Governor.</div>

<p>In the year 1667, the fishery of Newfoundland
underwent a more mature discussion
than it seems before to have received.
In August of that year several petitions,
were presented to the privy council from
the merchants, owners of ships, and others,
inhabitants of the towns of <i>Totness</i>, <i>Plymouth</i>,
<i>Dartmouth</i>, and places adjacent,
concerned in the trade to Newfoundland.
They stated, that several persons, upon specious
purposes, and for sinister ends, were
endeavouring to establish a <i>governor</i>, which
had always been pernicious to the fishery;
and because they were unable to attend
or bear the charges of solicitation, and
sending witnesses to such a distance, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
prayed his Majesty to empower such persons of
the county of Devon, as his Majesty
should think fit, to hear and examine
the whole matter, and make report
thereof to the council. Upon consideration
of these petitions, <i>Sir Edward Seymour</i>,
<i>Sir John Northcott</i>, <i>Sir William Courtnay</i>,
<i>Sir Thomas Carew</i>, <i>Sir Walter Young</i>, and
other gentlemen of Devonshire, were appointed
to enquire into facts concerning
the miscarriage of former governors to
the damage of the trade; and the petitioners
were also required to prepare reasons
to make good the allegations of their
petitions. In consequence of which, depositions
were taken at <i>Totness</i>, in which
were certified the inconvenience of appointing
a governor, and the prejudice that
would necessarily thereby ensue to the
fishery.</p>

<p>However, on the 6th December following,
the company of merchants, adventurers,
and owners of ships, trading from
<i>Bristol</i> to Newfoundland, and several other
merchants, petitioned his Majesty to provide
a remedy to the dangerous condition
of the fishery (which, they said, was likely
to fall into the hands of the French), by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
sending some able person as <i>governor</i>, with
guns, arms, ammunition, and other materials,
necessary for fortifying some of the
harbours. This matter was referred by
his Majesty to the <i>Earl of Anglesey</i>, <i>Lord
Ashley</i>, <i>Mr. Comptroller</i>, <i>Mr. Vice-Chamberlain</i>,
and <i>Sir William Coventry</i>. These
persons entered into an examination of all
the papers, and also of sundry merchants
and other persons; but no resolution
appears to have been taken thereon till
1669, when a Captain <i>Robert Robinson</i> petitioned
for the settlement of a governor;
and, on a reference of this question to the
lords of the committee for trade and plantations,
their lordships reported, after hearing
several merchants and others concerned
in the trade, “that they did not think fit
to recommend the petition and proposal
of <i>Mr. Robinson</i> for making him governor
of Newfoundland; but, for keeping
people living there in Christianity,
they proposed that his Majesty should
send a chaplain in the convoy-ships;
and <i>that the captains of the said ships should
have power to regulate abuses there</i>, with
reference to his Majesty’s letters patent
granted to the western towns;” which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
report was confirmed in every thing by his
majesty on the 4th of February following.</p>

<p>On the 25th of the same month, complaint
was made, that many owners of ships
carried out passengers, and private <i>boat-keepers</i>,
contrary to the laws and constitutions
of the fishery, to the great detriment
of the fishing trade, and to the lessening
of the number of ships and seamen;
that many owners also victualled their ships
from <i>Ireland</i>, instead of <i>England</i>. Upon
which, an order of council was made, directing
that the mayors and magistrates of
the several towns mentioned in the above
letters patent, should be careful that the
constitutions were punctually observed;
that the officers of the customs should
charge all masters and owners of ships to
put those rules in execution; should stop
offenders therein from proceeding in their
voyage, and immediately return their
names to the council.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the objections
made by many to the appointment of a
<i>governor</i>, those very persons felt the need
of government and regulation: for on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
23d of December 1670, a petition was presented
to his majesty, from the western
merchants and traders, “That additional
powers might be granted for regulating
the fishery.” The lords of the
council, appointed for matters of trade,
upon this occasion recommended several
rules; and his majesty ordered, that they
should be added to the former charter.
These were called <i>additional rules</i>, and
were as follows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Additional
Rules.</div>

<p>That his majesty’s subjects might take
bait and fish at Newfoundland, provided
they submitted to the established orders.—That
no alien should take bait.—That
no planter should cut down any wood, or
should plant within six miles of the sea shore.—That
no inhabitant or planter should
take up the best stages before the arrival of
the fishermen.—That no master or owner
of any ship should transport seamen, or
fishermen to Newfoundland, unless they
belonged to his ship’s company.—That
none should carry more than sixty persons
for a hundred tons.—That every fifth man
should be a green man, that is, not a seaman.—That
the masters of ships should
provide victual in England, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the number of men, for the whole voyage,
salt only excepted.—That no fishing
ship should part hence for Newfoundland,
before the month of <i>March</i>.—That masters
should give bond of a hundred pounds
to the respective mayors of the western
towns, not to carry to Newfoundland any
of the sort of persons before prohibited,
and to bring back such as they did carry
out, or employed in carrying fish for the
market voyages.—That no person should
take up a stage with less than twenty-five
men.—That no seaman or fisherman should
remain behind, after the fishing was ended.
It was ordered, that the admirals,
vice admirals, and rear admirals should
put these orders in execution, and preserve
the peace.—Should bring to England
offenders of any sort—Should proclaim
on the 20th of September, yearly,
his majesty’s orders.—Should keep journals.—It
was ordered that the recorders
and justices of the peace of the several
western towns, should be joined in
commission with the mayors.—That reasonable
fines should be imposed on offenders.</p>

<p>Finally, it was ordered, that a bill should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
be prepared to pass the great seal, for the
confirmation of the last <i>charter</i>, with these
<i>additional</i> powers; and that the clause
touching the marshal should be reviewed
by Mr. Attorney General, who should
present to the board <i>some way of judicature</i>,
for the determining of causes at Newfoundland.</p>

<p>In February 1674-5 the question of
appointing a governor was again brought
forward<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. A petition had been presented,
in which was set forth the great advantage
that would attend the fishing
trade, by a settlement under a <i>governor</i>;
This was referred by the king to the
lords of the committee for trade and
plantations; and after hearing the reasons
of the merchants and owners of ships in
the west of England, who protested against
a settlement, together with what the petitioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
could allege in behalf of a colony,
their lordships made report to his majesty,
of their opinion thereon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Report against
a Governor in
1675.</div>

<p>In this report it is stated, that for some
late years, the fish had failed in Newfoundland;
that the adventurers had
lost many of their ships in the late wars,
especially in that with <i>Spain</i>; and that
the late wars had much diminished the
hands which used to take fish: that the
inhabitants and planters, who, contrary to
their old charter, lived within six miles
of the sea, had destroyed the woods, and
continued to destroy whatever the adventurers
left behind them; that they possessed
early the places of greatest convenience,
and, which was very pernicious,
most of them sold wine, and brandy,
whereby the seamen were withdrawn from
their labor, and many seduced to stay in
the place, while their families thereby
became burthensome to their respective
parishes at home. That the inhabitants
lived scattered in five-and-twenty
different harbors, almost eighty leagues
asunder; and that in all the winter, when
abuses were chiefly committed, there was
no passing from one place to another, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that near forty harbors would have no
government, though the governor were
actually in the country.</p>

<p>It is also stated, that besides the charge
of forts, and a governor, which the fish-trade
could not support, it was needless to
have any such defence against foreigners,
the coast being defended in winter by the
ice, and in summer by the resort of the
king’s subjects; so that unless there were
proper reasons for a <i>colony</i>, there could be
none for <i>governor</i>. That against a colony,
there were not only the rigours of the climate,
and infertility of the land, which
obliged those who were there all the winter,
to idleness, and inclined them to debauchery,
but this, that they chiefly consumed
the produce of <i>New England</i>, by the
shipping of which country, they were
furnished with French wine and brandy,
and <i>Madeira</i> wines, in exchange for their
fish, without depending, as they should,
for supply from England; so that if the
climate and soil should favour a colony,
the planters would rather adhere to <i>New
England</i>, and so go on to tread in the same
steps as those colonists did, to the loss of
the many advantages which, by the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
method of things, are yet enjoyed by
the mother country; there being no hope
for a like regulation on the product of this
place as on the products of the other
plantations, because fish cannot bear the
charge of coming home, but must go <i>directly</i>
to the markets abroad.</p>

<p>It was reported that the French did not
manage their fishery otherwise, than by
adventurers’ ships, that went out, and returned
back yearly. That they maintained
a fort at <i>Placentia</i> to defend them from
the Indians, who, at certain times, came
off from the main, and molested them in
their beaver-trade; for which trade, and
not for fishing, the French had a residence
there.</p>

<p>It was reported, that the adventurers
caught fish cheaper than the planters.</p>

<p>Upon full consideration of all these circumstances,
their Lordships proposed,
that <i>all plantations in Newfoundland should
be discouraged</i>; and, in order thereunto,
that the commander of the convoy should
have commission to declare to all the planters,
to come voluntarily away; or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that the western charter should, from time
to time, be put in execution; by which
charter all planters were forbid to inhabit
within six miles of the shore, from Cape
<i>Race</i>, to Cape <i>Bonavista</i>. Their Lordships
further proposed, that the <i>additional
rules</i>, settled on the 10th of March, 1670,
should be observed, and that the mayors
of the western ports should be required to
renew their charter accordingly.</p>

<p>This report, from the Lords of the
committee of council for trade and plantations
was approved by his majesty, and
order was thereupon given for carrying
into effectual execution, what was there
recommended.</p>

<p>In viewing these transactions we plainly
discover the two contending interests in
the Newfoundland trade; the one that of
the planters and inhabitants, the other
that of the adventurers and merchants;
and we shall see, in the course of this
history, that according to the views of
these different description of persons, representations
were at various times made
to the government at home, for promoting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
or opposing regulations and establishments
in the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir John Berry’s
Advice.</div>

<p>An occasion soon offered for shewing this
spirit. Sir John Berry was appointed
to command the convoy for the ships
trading to Newfoundland; and in pursuance
of a special order of council of the
15th of April 1675, this commander laid
before the committee of council for trade
the state of Newfoundland, as he found
it, in relation as well to the <i>planters</i> and
<i>inhabitants</i>, as to the <i>western adventurers</i>;
and it is worth remarking how different is
the account given by this commander,
from that lately made by the adventurers,
and which had induced the committee of
council to report in the terms we have just
heard.</p>

<p>He says, that several disorders, attributed
to the planters, were chiefly occasioned
by the adventurers’ ships—That
the inhabitants never sold their fish to
those of <i>New England</i> for wine and brandy.—That
the adventurers’ men pulled down
the stages, and store-houses:—And, that
it was <i>their</i> fault, that the seamen were seduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to stay in the country, for it was to
save <i>thirty shillings for their passages</i>.</p>

<p>This letter was read at the committee
in the presence of several persons, who appeared
there in behalf of the west country
merchants, and who complained of the
encouragement <i>Sir John Berry</i> had given
the planters, contrary to his majesty’s orders,
and to the certain ruin of the adventurers’
trade, for such would follow from
the continuance of the inhabitants and
bye boat-keepers. Upon which the Lords
advised them to settle the <i>additional rules</i>,
allowed by his majesty; and this, some
time after, was accordingly put in execution.</p>

<p><i>Sir John Berry</i>, at his return, attended
the committee, where he repeated and
confirmed what he had written, and assured
their Lordships of the necessity
of encouraging a <i>colony</i> in Newfoundland,
if not, the French would take
advantage by the intended removal,
to make themselves masters of all the
harbours and fishing places about the
island, or would otherwise entice the English
planters to come and settle among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
them, to the great prejudice of our
fishery.</p>

<p>The struggle between the adventurers
and planters now grew very violent. In
1676, <i>John Downing</i>, an inhabitant of
Newfoundland, petitioned the king against
the endeavours of the adventurers to pull
down the houses, and burn the stages of
the planters, in order to drive them out of
the country. This complaint was referred
to the committee of trade, where counsel
were heard in behalf both of the adventurers
and planters; and the committee
having reported their opinion thereon, the
king signified his pleasure, that the masters
and seamen belonging to the fishing
ships should not any ways molest the
planters, upon pretence of a clause in the
western charter, whereby, “No person
was to inhabit within six miles of the
shore,” until his majesty should proceed
to a further resolution concerning
the fishery and plantation of Newfoundland.
Direction was accordingly
given, by order from his majesty, to the
captains of the convoy ships, to make
publication of his majesty’s pleasure, that
the planters should be permitted to continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in the possession of their houses and
stages, according to the usage of the last
years, until further order. Moreover,
that the state of the colony and trade
might be better known, they were ordered
to return answers to several <i>heads of inquiry</i>
prepared by the committee for trade
and plantations; and the following are the
answers thereto sent by <i>Sir William Pool</i>
from St. John’s harbour, dated the 10th
of September 1677.</p>

<p>He says, the fishermen confessed, that
of late years the planters had done no prejudice
to the fishery; so that, when they
returned, they found their stages in as
good order as could be after a winter; so
that they were not obliged to come sooner
to the island for the purpose of repairing
them—the planters affirmed, they did not
meddle with any of the adventurers’ fishing
places, nor did they desire to do it,
provided they might quietly enjoy the
same room they had possessed for several
years—the fishermen complained, that the
planters took up the best places to cure
their fish, did damage to their stages, and
took possession of more than they had
hands to manage—the planters affirmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that it was impossible to live six miles
from the sea-side, by reason of the barrenness
of the country—the fishermen did not
desire the removal of the planters, but only
a better regulation—the planters could not
keep a constant number of men or boats,
unless they were supplied every year with
servants from England—the planters did
not take so much fish, proportionably to the
number of men and boats they kept, as the
fishers did, who were better artists; nor sell
it so cheap, by reason of the greater wages
they were obliged to give their servants—it
was not possible for the planters to observe
the charter punctually—the planters
all sold drink contrary to their charter—the
fishermen rinded the trees, and employed
six and seven stages for seventy men,
contrary to the rule of their charter—the
French managed their fishery generally by
fish-ships from Europe, and their trade for
fur was very inconsiderable—the French
planters were very much encouraged by
the governor, and had the same accommodation
in their harbours as the fishermen
had—the fishermen confessed the planters
were of great use to them—the planters
prepared materials for the fishermen against
their coming, which otherwise could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
be made ready without a great loss of time;
they preserved in their houses the salt
that remained of the fishery until the next
season; and when shipping was wanting,
the fishermen were glad to lodge their fish
in a planter’s house until the following
year—in case the fishermen were visited
with sickness, or were obliged to stay for
their ships on their first arrival, they used
the convenience of the planters’ houses—when
the fishermen wanted provisions, the
planters supplied them out of their stores;
or when they had an overplus, the planters
bought it of them for fish.</p>

<p>Such were the answers given by the
commander of the king’s ships on this
station to the first <i>heads of enquiry</i> concerning
the trade and fishery. This method
of enquiry was followed in after
times; and the information it produced,
in this first attempt, may be made useful
matter of comparison.</p>

<p>In December 1677, the committee for
trade and plantations, in pursuance of an
order of council, that had been made on
the petition of the western adventurers,
made report, that notwithstanding a clause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in the western charter, forbidding the
transportation of any persons to Newfoundland,
than such as were of the ships’
company, the magistrates of the several
western ports did permit passengers, and
private <i>boat-keepers</i>, to transport themselves
thither, to the detriment of the fishery;
but they were of opinion this might, for
the future, be prevented, if not only those
magistrates, but the vice-admirals and
officers of the customs, were strictly commanded
to prevent this abuse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bye Boat-keepers,
what.</div>

<p>The private boat-keepers here spoken
of, or <i>bye boat-keepers</i>, as they otherwise
were called, are described as persons who,
not being willing or able to buy a share in
a fishing ship, hired servants in the west of
England, and carried them as passengers
to Newfoundland, where they employed
them in private boats to catch and cure
fish; and after the season was over, they
brought them back to England, or permitted
them to take service with the planters,
or on board the ships. These bye
boat-keepers used to go over yearly in great
numbers; but this practice being contrary to
the western charter, and the king’s express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
command, begun now to be much disused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question of a
Colony argued.</div>

<p>The above-mentioned representation
against the bye boat-keepers was soon
followed by a petition in behalf of the
inhabitants of Newfoundland, praying generally,
that nothing might be ordered to
their prejudice. To bring this matter
into full discussion, it was ordered by
the king, that both the adventurers and
planters should be heard by their counsel.
And thus was the question of the convenience
and inconvenience of a colony solemnly
argued at the council. After which
it was referred to the committee for trade,
to propose some regulation between the
adventurers and planters, which might
consist with the preservation of the interest
of the crown, and the encouragement of
navigation and the fishing trade<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>It does not appear what report was
upon this occasion made by the committee
for trade; and I find no other
proceedings of the government respecting
this trade and fishery till after the year 1696,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
when the board of trade was instituted.—In
January 1697, the new board took up
this among other subjects that came within
their cognizance; but not before they
were called upon by petitions and representations
from the towns in the west
concerned in this trade. These, like former
petitions and representations from the
adventurers and fishers, were calculated to
advance their pretensions, in opposition to
those of the planters and inhabitants, to
deprecate the appointment of a governor,
and to pray a convoy for the safety of the
ships going out, either to <i>Portugal</i> for
salt, or to Newfoundland, and to protect
them in their return home, or in their
voyage to market<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. The report and
representation made by the board on
this occasion applied rather to the present
defence of the place than to any matter of
general regulation; and they at the same
time expressed an opinion, that planters,
in a moderate number, were at all times
convenient for the preparation and preservation
of boats, stages, and other things
necessary for the fishery; but that they
should not exceed <i>one thousand</i><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1698 was passed the stat. 10
and 11 Will. 3. c. 25. intituled, <i>An Act
to encourage the trade to Newfoundland</i>. It
does not appear what were the steps that
immediately led to the passing of the act;
but it appears, in the matter of it, to be
founded on the policy of former times; and
it is, in truth, little more than an enactment
of the rules, regulations, and constitution
that had mostly prevailed there for
some time.</p>

</div>


<p>It has ever been the disposition of the
principal merchants in the west of England
to extol the provisions of stat. 10 and
11 Will. 3. as the soundest policy that
could be pursued in relation to the fishery.
We know, after perusal of the former part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of this historical enquiry, that there was
always an opposition and jealousy subsisting
between the <i>merchants and adventurers
on the one hand</i>, and the <i>planters and inhabitants</i>
on the other; and the utmost credit
we can give to the former, on this subject,
is to believe, that this statute fully established
their claims and pretensions, and
gave them an ascendancy over the latter;
and that they now saw sanctioned by parliament,
what before depended upon a
tenure of less validity. So far, and no
farther, can this eulogy have a meaning;
for as a scheme of regulation, that was to be
generally beneficial, this act was, in the first
place, no novelty; in the second place
it seems never, from the very beginning,
to have been completely executed; and
thirdly, it gave power and jurisdiction to
hands that were unfit to exercise it: and I
shall presently shew, that those concede
too much, who allow this act might have
been a very good regulation at the time it
passed; for it will appear from the best
authority, that, at the very time it was
passed, it was in no way of being carried
into execution as the parliament intended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>To the <i>heads of inquiry</i>, which were delivered
and given in charge to the commodore,
who commanded the ships on
that station, this act, and all the particulars
of it, were now added; and there appear
in the returns made thereto every year,
their observations and opinion, both upon
the act and its execution. Upon such a
subject there cannot be adduced better
authority than this. In the answers given
to these <i>heads of inquiry</i>, and in the correspondence
of the commodores, may be
traced, from time to time, the actual state
of the fishery; and it will be curious to
bring together the information that may
be collected from these sources. Among
the earliest information of this sort, I find
a letter from <i>Mr. George Larkin</i>, written
from St. John’s in the year 1701. This
was recently after the passing of the act;
and the writer goes more fully into
many points of the trade, than the officers
of government usually did. These
circumstances make this a valuable
paper; and it becomes much more so,
when it is considered, that Mr. Larkin
was a gentleman bred to the civil law,
who was sent out to make observations
in the American settlements, for the information
of government at home, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to the state of the Plantations, and the
execution of the laws of trade and navigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Larkin’s
Observations in
1701.</div>

<p>He begins by saying, that the rules and
orders of this act were not so much regarded
as he could wish, which he ascribes
to there being no penalties in it. The trees
were rinded, and the woods destroyed, as
much as before passing the act; and in a
few years, he thought there would not be
a stick left fit for the use of the fishery within
five or six miles of that, or other harbours.
The flakes that were left standing, were
most of them made use of by the inhabitants
for firing in the winter.</p>

<p>He says, the then admiral of the harbour
of St. John’s, <i>Captain Arthur Holdsworth</i>,
of Dartmouth, brought over from
England, that fishing season, two hundred
and thirty-six passengers, all or great part
of which were <i>bye boat-keepers</i>, and they
were brought, under a pretence of being
freighters aboard his ship, though it was
only for some few provisions for their necessary
use. These persons he had put and
continued in the most convenient stages, &amp;c.
in the harbour, which all along, since the
year 1685, had belonged to fishing ships;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in so much, that several masters of fishing
ships had been obliged to hire rooms of
the planters. These bye boat-keepers
were most of them, he says, able fishermen,
and there was not one fresh man, or
green man, amongst them, as the act requires.
He says, that this person, and
one or two more, who constantly used the
fishery, made it their business in the beginning
of the year, to ride from one market
town to another in the west of England,
on purpose to get passengers; with whom
they made an agreement, that in case they
should happen to be admirals of any of
the harbours, they would put and continue
Mr. Holdsworth, and such persons, in
fishing ships’ rooms. This, he says, was
a very great abuse and discouragement
to the adventurers: besides, these
bye boat-keepers could afford to sell
their fish cheaper than the adventurers,
which must lessen the number of fishing
ships.</p>

<p>There was great complaint of the <i>New
England-men</i>, who for seven or eight
years, he says, had resorted to Newfoundland.
They had also their agents in most
of the harbours, and drove an indirect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
trade, supplying several commodities to the
planters, which they ought to take from
England. Such New England vessels generally
made two or three trips in a year,
with bread, flour, pork, tobacco, molasses,
sugar, lime-juice, and rum. They sold
cheaper in general, but obliged their purchasers
to take certain quantities of rum.
This the inhabitants sold to the fishermen,
and so encouraged them to stay behind,
and leave their families in England a burthen
on the parish. The inhabitants also
sold rum to their servants, who run in debt,
and were forced to hire themselves in payment
of their debt; so that one month’s
profuse living, and a pair of shoes, often
left them in bondage for a year; and
good fishermen, who deserved fifteen or
twenty pounds per annum, were thus made
to serve for seven pounds. He says, the
<i>New Englanders</i>, at the close of the year,
used to inveigle away a great many seamen
and servants, with promises of great wages;
but these men were often disappointed,
and turned robbers and pirates. The
New England vessels were said, the last year,
to have taken away five hundred men in
this manner, in <i>Conception Bay</i> only; many
of these were headed up in casks to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
discovery. He recommends, for preventing
this practice, that the masters of New
England vessels should give bond, when
they cleared out, not to bring men from
Newfoundland without leave from the
commodore.</p>

<p>We find, in after times, the captains of
the king’s ships used to oblige every New
England master of a ship to give such bond,
in a penalty of five hundred pounds, with
two sureties in two hundred and fifty
pounds each, not to carry any persons out
of the island.</p>

<p>As to the fishery, he did not hear of
more than one New England vessel fishing
on the coast. Indeed it appears, that
<i>their</i> fishery was all carried on upon their
own coast, where they had better fish, and
that they looked to Newfoundland for nothing
but the sort of traffic above-mentioned.</p>

<p>He informs us, that the inhabitants and
planters of Newfoundland were poor, indigent,
and withall a profuse sort of
people, that cared not at what rates they
got into debt, nor what obligations they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
gave, so they could have credit. But the
seizing of their fish for debt, seemed to this
gentleman to be both irregular and unjust,
as to the time and manner of doing it;
for the fishermen seeing the flakes stript
before the fishing season was half over, were
discouraged from proceeding any further;
which often proved the ruin and overthrow
of several planters’ voyages.</p>

<p>Debts used not to be paid till the
20th of August; but, for two and three
years, he says, the flakes had been stript
by night, and the fish carried off in June
and July, without weighing. A second
had come, and taken it from the first—the
planter had had twenty or thirty quintals
of fish spoiled in the scuffle, and the rest
of his creditors were forced to go without
any satisfaction. The poor fishermen,
who helpt to take the fish, had, on these
occasions, gone without one penny of
wages—salt provisions and craft being always
payable before wages; and he expresses
astonishment, how the planters and
inhabitants could procure hands from England
to fish for them, considering how ill
they used them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of the
fishing admirals.</div>

<p>Where complaints of this sort had been
made to the commander in chief, he had
ordered them to re-deliver the fish, and a
dividend to be made. But there being
five or six and twenty different harbours,
besides coves, and it being a great distance
from <i>Bonavista</i> and <i>Fermose</i>, to <i>St.
John’s</i> to make complaints, the commander
could do little; and the admirals, he
says, did not concern themselves at all,
but left all to the commander. These
admirals, says he, ought to see to the preservation
of the peace and good government
among the seamen and fishermen,
that the order and regulation of the fishery
be put in execution; and they should keep
journals: but instead of this, they were
the first to break these orders, and there
was not one of them, where <i>he</i> had been,
who had kept any journal at all.</p>

<p>He observes, that the late act of king
William gave the planters a <i>title</i>, and it
was a pity but that they had some laws
and rules by which they should be governed;
though, he says, it was the opinion of
all, since he had come there, that it had
been better, if all plantations had been
discouraged, for the island was then become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a sanctuary and place of refuge for
all people that broke in England. Besides,
the masters of the fishing ships encouraged
several of their men to stay behind,
persuading them they would soon
get estates there; and this they did merely
to save the charge of their passage back
to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of the
Commanders.</div>

<p>It had been customary for the commander
in chief, upon complaints made,
to send his lieutenants to the several harbours
and coves, to decide all differences
and disputes that happened between masters
of merchant ships and the inhabitants,
and between them and their servants;
this gentleman declares it a shame to
hear how matters had been transacted
upon such occasions. He that made a
present of the most quintals of fish, was
sure to have the determination in his favour.
He says, the whole country exclaimed
against the lieutenants in <i>Captain
Poulton</i> and <i>Captain Fairbourne’s</i> time; and
did not scruple to declare, that some former
commanders in chief had been a little
faulty. He says, the then commander,
<i>Captain Graydon</i>, had taken much pains to
do the country justice, and to settle religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
amongst them, and people seemed
well satisfied with him. He says, there
had never been any registry kept of the
<i>orders</i> or <i>rules</i> that had been made for the
good of the fishery. What one commander
in chief had established, another
had vacated; he says, he had prevailed
with the present commander to leave an
abstract of all such as had been made during
his time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of Police.</div>

<p>He says, that quarrels and disputes happened
after the fishing season was over; and
in the rigour of the winter season, masters
beat servants, and servants their masters.
He therefore recommends, that one of the
most substantial inhabitants should be appointed
in every harbour in the nature
of a justice, for preservation of the peace,
and tranquillity among them; and that
some one, who understood the law, should
be sent with the commander in chief, or
should reside there, as should be thought
most convenient, in the nature of a judge
advocate, to decide all differences, and
matters of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> between masters
of ships, inhabitants, planters, and
servants; that this person should have
power to administer an oath to parties, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
witnesses, for determination thereof in the
most summary way, and that he should
be obliged to go every year to the following
places; viz. <i>Bonavista</i>, <i>Trinity</i>, <i>New
Perlican</i>, <i>Old Perlican</i>, <i>Carboneer</i>, <i>St. John’s</i>,
<i>Bay of Bulls</i>, and <i>Ferryland</i>, and to stay a
fortnight or three weeks at each of them.
He adds, that such a person would be useful
there for several purposes, and among
others, that a true account might be had
from him, how all matters were transacted
at Newfoundland<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>The picture here given of Newfoundland
is hardly heightened, or varied by
any colouring to be found in the representations
made by successive commanders.
They are usually in the same strain. The
grievances and complaints, the remedies
and expedients are uniformly the same;
and it is a remarkable circumstance in the
history of this trade, that many of the papers
relating to it, whether coming from
the commanders, or from the merchants
and adventurers, in the times of king William
and Queen Anne, would apply to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
later times, as well as to those in which
they originated.</p>

<p>The <i>heads of enquiry</i> given in charge to
the commanders, and the answers returned
by them thereto, would furnish a history
of the fishery. These heads soon encreased
from twenty or thirty, to sixty or seventy.
It is not my intention to go over all these,
or to pursue every point that has arisen,
at various periods, with relation to this
fishery and trade; but principally to trace
the progress made in affording that island
some sort of <i>constitution</i>; and the settling
of this, like the settling of all other constitutions,
will involve in it the parties,
and different interests that have, and still
continue to prevail amongst the individuals
concerned in the trade, both here and
in Newfoundland.</p>

<p>In the answers made by Captain Graydon,
the commander, at this time, we
find, that a survey was made that year of
all the encroachments made by the inhabitants
upon the liberties of fishing ships, since
the year 1685, and they were all corrected,
as appears from him.—That the admirals
of the harbours were the persons, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
mostly brought bye boat-keepers, and
put them in possession of ship’s rooms, under
notion of their being freighters (as
was before alledged) the admirals advancing
them money in England at five
shillings in the pound.—The admirals did
not observe the rules prescribed in the act
of parliament, but on the contrary, when
they wheedled a poor planter into debt,
they took his fish by force from him,
and would even break open his house
to get it. As to the admirals keeping
journals, accounts, &amp;c. he found but
four of them <i>capable</i> of doing it.—The
admirals, before the 20th of August,
used to hear some complaints, but after
that, none were made to them, they being
generally the greatest aggressors themselves.</p>

<p>Such are the observations made upon
those points, that are more particularly
for our consideration at present. We shall
find, as we go on, how uniform were the
complaints of abuses, and irregularities
in the police and government of the
island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion of the
Board 106.</div>

<p>In the year 1702, the war with France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
broke out, and our fishery and concerns
there were greatly disturbed by the French.
During this, the questions agitated at the
board of trade mostly concerned the defence
of the island by sea and land. Notwithstanding
this state of war, an order
was made by the House of Commons, the
16th of January 1705-6, for laying before
the house a state of the trade, and fishery;
a state was for this purpose drawn up by
the board; in this they give their opinion
upon the different abuses and grievances;
and, amongst other things, recommend
that power should be given by parliament
to the commanders of the queen’s ships,
and to the admirals, to inflict fines and
penalties on the breaches of Stat. 10 &amp; 11
Will. 3, c. 25. they recommend also, that
the commanders of the queen’s ships should
have the power of custom-house officers to
search ships from <i>New England</i><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>—In the
same year they recommended to her majesty,
that the mayors of the towns in the west,
should be written to, requiring them to
enjoin the masters of ships, who might become
admirals, to keep journals, and discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the other duties required of them
by Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3, c. 25<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>The board were called upon again the
next year by the House of Commons for
a state of the trade<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, which was accordingly
furnished, and in this statement
the same abuses were recounted and the
same remedies were suggested for their
correction.</p>

<p>On the 31 of March 1708, the House
of Commons addressed her majesty, beseeching
her to give directions, that the
laws relating to the trade and fishery of
Newfoundland might be effectually put
in execution against such commanders of
her majesty’s ships of war, or forts, or
fortifications there, as should presume to
exact, demand, or receive sums of money,
or other rewards from any of the
queen’s subjects, in their voyages, trade,
or fishery to, from, or at Newfoundland:
And that such commanders and officers
should be strictly forbidden to keep, use,
or employ any fishing boats for their
own private use or advantage: further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that the laws relating to the fishery should
be duly executed<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. This address was
occasioned by some complaints made
against a <i>Major Lloyd</i>, who commanded
the troops at <i>St. John’s</i>; but of
this gentleman’s conduct there were different
accounts; the most unfavourable
seem to have prevailed with the House
of Commons to come to this resolution.</p>

<p>This call for a due execution of the
laws relating to the fishery, again drew
the attention of the board of trade to the
Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3, c. 25. and the defect,
so often complained of in that act,
“not having any penalties specially annexed
to the breach of it.” And on a
question proposed by the board to Mr.
<i>Montagu</i>, then solicitor general, he declared
it to be clear, that although no particular
penalty was mentioned in an act of
parliament, requiring or prohibiting any
thing, yet any offender against such act
may be fined at the discretion of the
court, when found guilty on an indictment
or information<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Representation
1708. For the sea commanders
to
command at
land.</div>

<p>The board then proceeded to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
representation to her majesty on the occasion
of the before-mentioned address;
in which they say, that no complaint had
ever come to them of exactions, or demands
made by commanders of the queen’s
ships; and if there were, the offender
should be prosecuted on Stat. 15 Car. 2.
c. 16. That the charge against <i>Major
Lloyd</i>, for letting out the soldiers to
work in the fishery, was under examination
at the board. But that for preventing
any misconduct of officers with
relation to the fishery and trade in future,
they recommended, that the commodore,
during his stay there, should have the
command at land, as he used to have
from the first sending out of a garrison,
till within the last three years, when that
practice was discontinued. They thought
this would contribute better to support
good order and peace, in a place where
no regular civil government was established;
and that it would enable him to
superintend the queen’s stores, and to
make better returns of the state of the
trade and fishery. As to the execution
of the act in general, they stated the abuses
and irregularity subsisting in the island;
the ignorance and partiality of the fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
admirals; and they recommended that
the commodore should be impowered to
redress and punish all offences, and abuses
committed at Newfoundland against Stat.
10 &amp; 11 Will. 3, c. 25.; as to those which
he could not redress, they recommended he
should inform himself whether the provisions
of the act were duly complied with,
and who were the offenders against them,
in order that they might be proceeded
against in this kingdom. They submitted
whether it would not be proper to
issue a royal proclamation for better observation
of this law<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Such commission
issues.</div>

<p>This representation was approved by
the queen, and an order of council was
made on the 20th of May 1708, directing
a proclamation of the sort therein recommended,
to issue; and also a commission
to be prepared annually by the Lords
Commissioners for trade and plantations,
for the commodore of the Newfoundland
convoys, to command at land, during his
stay in those parts, with such further <i>instructions</i>
for putting in execution that act
of parliament, as were set forth in the representation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the Lords were also directed
to prepare a letter to <i>Major Lloyd</i>, disapproving
his proceedings, and requiring
him to yield due obedience to the commodore’s
commission: all which was accordingly
carried into execution<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. <i>Instructions</i>
were delivered to the commodore
for executing this commission to
command at land; and in one of those he
was directed to send answers to the <i>heads
of enquiry</i>, which had long been in use, relating
to the trade and fishery, and which
were always prepared by the board of
trade, and afterward given in charge to
the commander by the lord high Admiral.</p>

<p>This change in the command at Newfoundland
set the lords of trade upon
an enquiry after the commission (before
noticed) given in 1615 to <i>Captain
Whiteburn</i> out of the court of admiralty
for impanelling juries<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. It seems
also, that it was in agitation for the
commissioners of the customs to appoint
an officer for preventing illicit trade
in Newfoundland. The lords of trade
were informed from the custom-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that when a court of admiralty should be
erected, and a person appointed to hear
and determine causes on informations of
seisures, a revenue officer should have his
commission and instructions.</p>

<p>But the French had got so strong, and
had so disturbed our possessions in the island,
that every thing gave way to plans of immediate
and necessary defence. Through
the year 1710, the merchants were
making representations to the board of
trade, beseeching, that in any treaty of
peace with the French, Newfoundland
might be reserved wholly to the English.
This idea was adopted by the board, and
they appear to have pressed it strongly with
her Majesty’s ministers<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laws and orders
made at
Newfoundland.</div>

<p>In the year 1711, I find, what is called,
<i>a record of several laws and orders made at
St. John’s for the better discipline and good
order of the people, and for correcting irregularities
committed contrary to good laws, and
acts of parliaments, all which were debated
at several courts held, wherein were present
the commanders of merchants’ ships, merchants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and chief inhabitants; and witnesses being
examined, it was brought to the following
conclusion between the 23d day of August and
23d day of October 1711.</i> Then follow
fifteen articles of regulation<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, that must
have been very useful; and it is worth
considering whether such a local legislature,
which the people seem in this instance
to have created for themselves,
might not legally be lodged somewhere,
for making bye-laws and regulations, as
occasion should require. The commander
<i>Captain Crowe</i>, presided at this voluntary
assembly. His successor, it seems, followed
his example, and held a meeting
of the same sort. These assemblies were
somewhat anomalous, a kind of legislative,
judicial, and executive, all blended
together<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; and yet perhaps not more
mixed than the proceedings of parliaments
in Europe, in very early times.</p>

<p>At the peace of Utrecht we were put into
possession of Newfoundland in a way we
had not enjoyed it before, for some years.
Placentia, and all the parts occupied by the
French, were now ceded to the king of Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Britain, in full sovereignty; the French
retaining nothing more than a licence to
come and go during the fishing season. A
new prospect now opened; and the government,
not less than the merchants, turned
their thoughts to that trade with a spirit
that promised itself all the fruits of
this new acquisition. A <i>Captain Taverner</i> was
employed to survey the island, its harbours,
and bays; a lieutenant-governor
was appointed to command the fort at
<i>Placentia</i>; the merchants beseeched the
board of trade that the French might be
strictly watched, and kept to their limits,
and that a ship should go round the island,
to see they left the different harbours at
the close of the season.</p>

<p><i>Captain Taverner</i>, who had great experience
in that trade, and was much attended
to at this time, gave in to the board
some remarks on the Newfoundland fishery
and trade; and also heads of a proposed
act of parliament<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. It appears from the
observations made by this gentleman, as
well as many others, that nothing was
more strongly expressed by all persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
who shewed any anxiety, or experience on
this subject, than the inefficiency of Stat.
10 &amp; 11 Will. 3, and the necessity of going
to parliament for new regulations.</p>

<p>It had become a doubt, whether that
part of the island, lately ceded by the
French, was subject to the provisions of
Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3. This point was
brought forward, in consequence of the
lieutenant-governor of the garrison at <i>Placentia</i>,
and some of the French planters
having, on leaving the place, disposed of
their plantations for money, and, in this
manner, attempted to convey a right and
property, which was not recognised by the
general usage of the island, as confirmed
by that statute. This matter was brought
before the board of trade, and their lordships
were of opinion, that Stat. 10 &amp; 11
Will. 3. extended to the ceded lands, and
that all the beaches, and plantations there,
ought to be left to the public use, and
be disposed of, as directed by that act<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.
Instructions to that effect were accordingly
given to the lieutenant-governor of
<i>Placentia</i><a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the proposals and suggestions
for improving the trade of Newfoundland,
some papers from <i>Mr. Campbell</i>, in the
year 1714 are deserving of notice<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>The Newfoundland trade was taken up
by the government in the year 1715, as
an object of important consideration.
<i>Captain Kempthorn</i>, then on that station,
was specially charged to make enquiry,
and report every information he could acquire;
and I find a very long letter written
by him to the secretary of the admiralty,
and transmitted from thence to the
board of trade. This letter is very full,
and was submitted by the board to the
king’s government, as containing suggestions
highly deserving consideration<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
The board were now satisfied that some
new regulation ought to be made by parliament;
and preparatory thereto, they resolved
to write to the towns in the west,
concerned in this trade, desiring them to
furnish such information as they possessed
upon a subject where they had so much
experience<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. They also laid a case before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the attorney general, <i>Sir Edward Northey</i>,
for his opinion on the defects of Stat. 10 &amp;
11 Will. 3. and he was of opinion, that it
would be necessary, in order to oblige the
observation of the rules contained in that
statute, for a new act to be passed, inflicting
<i>penalties</i> for not observing the same,
and directing how and where such penalties
should be paid; and he thought that
a proclamation, requiring the observance
of those rules (as was before proposed)
would have no effect<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. On this occasion.
<i>Mr. Taverner</i> suggested his remarks, and
gave a sketch of a bill<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. After the board
had derived the information that was to
be obtained from the different sources,
where they had applied, they drew up a
long <i>representation</i> to his majesty, dated the
2d of March 1715-6 containing their opinion
upon the abuses, suggesting the
remedies that would be proper to be applied<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>,
and recommending that a bill
should be proposed to parliament for
giving effect to the suggestions there
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Representation
1718.</div>

<p>Nothing was at that time done; but the
board continued to pursue the course they
had taken for obtaining information: for
in August 1718, we find a very full answer
given in by <i>Captain Passenger</i> upon the
whole of the subject of the trade and
fishery; and in December following, the
board made a <i>representation</i> to his majesty,
more elaborate, full, and comprehensive,
than any performance that had yet been
seen, respecting this trade and fishery; and
to this they afterwards added the <i>heads of a
bill</i>, to be proposed to parliament, for
establishing the trade and fishery, and correcting
the abuses to which it had been subject<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
This representation, and the heads
of the bill, have been lately laid before the
house of commons, and are now printed
by their order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Claim of the
Guipuscoans to
fish.</div>

<p>About this time, the <i>Guipuscoans</i> had
set up an antient right to fish at Newfoundland;
and application had been made
to our court for asserting and allowing this
claim. This matter was referred to the
board of trade; and that board did, on
the 11th of September 1719, make a
<i>representation</i> to the lords justices; in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
they say, that by the fifteenth article of
the treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>, the <i>Guipuscoans</i> could
claim no right, but such as they could
make out by some prior title; they then
recapitulated the ancient history of our
discovery and possession of the island; and
that by stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. all aliens
are expressly excluded from the fishery;
and they conclude, that the island and the
fishery are the undoubted property of his
majesty, and that the <i>Guipuscoans</i> had no
manner of right to fish or trade there<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.
They take this occasion to remind the
lords justices of the representation they
had made last year, and of the heads of a
bill then suggested for better regulating
the fishery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of the Lands
ceded by the
French.</div>

<p>The parts that had been surrendered
by the French, occasioned in various ways
great contest and discontent. We have
before seen, that it was the opinion of the
board, that those parts fell under all the regulations
of the stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3.;
and this was confirmed by the opinion of the
law officers. Another difficulty arose, in
consequence of an agreement made by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Queen with the king of France, which went
beyond the terms of the treaty of Utrecht.
The French were by the treaty allowed to
remain and enjoy their estates and settlements,
provided they qualified themselves
to be subjects of Great Britain—those who
would not do this, had leave to go elsewhere;
and take with them their <i>moveable</i> effects.
<i>Queen Anne</i>, in consideration of the king of
France releasing a number of protestant
slaves out of the gallies, permitted the
French inhabitants of <i>Placentia</i>, who were
not willing to become her subjects, to sell
their <i>houses</i> and <i>lands</i> there. It became therefore
a <i>question</i>, whether this permission of the
queen was valid, so as to dispose of <i>lands</i>
which came to the crown by treaty. This
point was submitted to <i>Mr. West</i>, counsel
to the board of trade, for his opinion; and
it was material to settle it, because many
British subjects had purchased such lands
from the French inhabitants.</p>

<p>His answer was, that the queen could
not by her letter dispose of lands granted
to the crown by treaty; but if she entered
into any regular agreement with the court
of France for that purpose, she was, by the
law of nations, engaged to do every thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in her power to enable the French to have
the benefit of it; which might be done by
her confirming titles to such of her
subjects as should pay the French a confederation
in money, or otherwise, for their
lands or houses<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. Many such lands purchased
by <i>Governor Moody</i>, having been
used for fortifications, the board recommended
compensation to be made him
by the crown.</p>

<p>But when this question was so answered,
what became of the right to
ships’ rooms, as established by stat. 10
and 11 Will. 3. which statute was held to
apply to the French parts now ceded, as
well as to the other? <i>Placentia</i> being the
best part for fishing, the English complained
they were deprived of the benefit they
had promised themselves, by this new acquisition,
as they could not resort thither,
without paying high rents for a plantation
to cure their fish. In truth, many French still
continued there, and they gave encouragement
also to <i>Biscayans</i>, and to the people of
<i>Guipuscoa</i>, who, we have seen, were starting
a pretension to fish at Newfoundland, of
right. All these together constituted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
source of great discontent, and so continued
for several years<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Salmon Fishery
granted.</div>

<p>Another question, as to the right of property
at Newfoundland, arose upon a <i>salmon
fishery</i>, which had been carried on and
improved by <i>Mr. Skeffington</i>, between <i>Cape
Bonavista</i> and <i>Cape John</i>, in a part never
frequented by any fishing ships; he had
cleared the country up the rivers for forty
miles, and had built houses and stages.
This person applied for an exclusive grant
of this fishery for a term of years;—the
matter being referred to <i>Mr. West</i>, he reported,
that such a grant would not be inconsistent
with the stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.
The board accordingly recommended to his
majesty, that a term of 21 years, in a sole
fishery for salmon, in <i>Fresh-water Bay</i>,
<i>Ragged Harbour</i>, <i>Gander Bay</i>, and <i>Dog
Creek</i>, might very well be granted by his
majesty, with liberty to cut wood and timber
in the parts adjacent, provided it were
at six miles distant from the shore<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>In the close of the year 1728, we find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
board of trade once more took up the
subject of this trade and fishery, in consequence
of the representations made by
<i>Lord Vere Beauclerck</i>, the commodore on
that station. In order to bring the subject
under full discussion, they caused letters
to be written to the chief magistrates of
the different towns in the west, requesting
the merchants to send their thoughts, whether
any thing, and what, might be done
for the further encouragement of the
fishery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion on Sec.
7, of Stat. 10
and 11 Will 3.</div>

<p>With a view of understanding the situation
and tenure by which persons held
their lands in Newfoundland, the board
referred, at this time, a question to <i>Mr.
Fane</i> on the seventh clause of stat. 10 and
11 Will 3. “Whether the possessors had
an inheritance therein, or only an estate
for life?” and he was of opinion, that by
the words of this clause, an estate for life
only passed to the possessors, and consequently
a right of alienation only for that
interest, for the following reasons:—1st.
From the general rule of law, that the
king’s right and interest can never be
bound by general words—2dly. From the
inconvenience that would ensue, if by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
general words an estate of inheritance
should be construed to be given; for these
houses, &amp;c. might fall into hands improper
for carrying on the fishery, or be
bought by such as are in the interest of
our enemies; or such new erections, houses,
&amp;c. might be purchased by one person, or
two, and so an engrossing established, against
the design and intention of the act—3dly.
From the words of the clause, which seem
to confine the possession to the builder; for
the act says, <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">HIS</span> <i>or</i> <span class="smcap">THEIR</span> <i>use</i>; which
implies, as he apprehended, that this is
only a personal privilege; and a privilege
it was sufficient, to have an estate for life
in a house, &amp;c. probably slightly built;
and which, in all likelihood, would only
last for the life of the builder—4thly. This
act was made, he apprehended, in disfavour
of the Newfoundland-men; and it
could not be supposed such a favourable
provision, in this instance, would be made
for them, when they were discountenanced
in every other clause of the act; especially
too against the right and interest of the
crown, which, in all doubtful cases, must
be preferred<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Representation
1728.</div>

<p>The letter to the mayors of the western
towns produced only two answers; one of
which consisted of a complaint against
<i>Colonel Gledhill</i>, the lieutenant governor of
<i>Placentia</i>, for encroaching upon the fishing
rooms, engaging in the fishery, and
using his power in an illegal and arbitrary
manner; the other complained of the illicit
trade of the <i>New England men</i>. Not
the least advice was given as to any mode
of correcting irregularities, nor was any
thing said as to the want of order, and good
government. The board were, therefore,
left to take such course as they in their
wisdom should think proper. They accordingly
proceeded on such evidence as
they had, and drew up a representation to
his majesty, dated the 20th of December
1728. In which they declare, “That
the want of sufficient power in the commodore
for enforcing the act of parliament,
and the general contempt, into
which the authority vested in the fishing
admirals had fallen, had reduced the
fishery to a very bad condition; and,
unless proper remedies were applied, in
all probability we should entirely be
deprived of the advantages derived by
the nation from this trade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>They then go over the abuses and irregularities
so often complained of; the increase
of bye boat-keepers, the settling of
persons in the island, the enticing away
of seamen, and fishermen by the <i>New
Englanders</i>, who also carried on an illicit
trade; the disorders of the garrison at
<i>Placentia</i>; the clashing interests of the
adventurers and the planters; and the inefficacy
of Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3. They
remind his majesty of their representations
of the 2d of March 1715-16, and especially
of that of the 16th of December 1718,
and the <i>heads of a bill</i> annexed to the latter.
They submit that so much of that,
as may be thought proper, may be proposed
to parliament immediately; they
judging that an <i>intire remedy</i> for the
evils complained of, could not be effected,
without the assistance of the legislature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recommends
civil government.</div>

<p>However, they said, there were some
irregularities, which could be corrected by
the king’s own authority, without the interposition
of parliament; those were, the
irregularities of the garrison, and the disorders
committed in the winter season.
With respect to the former, they recommend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
that considering the lieutenant governor
of <i>Placentia</i> thought himself accountable
to no one but the king, a nearer
controul and check over his conduct would
keep him within bounds; and therefore,
that the commodore on the station should
be commander in chief both by sea and
land, as had formerly been the practice,
which would at once put an end to the
competition, and jealousy, which had so
long subsisted between the land and sea
forces. As to the second, they recommend,
that the commodore might have
power to appoint judges, and justices of
the peace, to decide disputes between the
inhabitants, and distribute justice amongst
them during the winter season. This they
thought would alleviate the misery of
those unhappy people, which was great
enough without additional evils from
the anarchy in which they lived. They
say, that heretofore much encouragement
had not been given the settlers, to continue
in the island, and therefore regular
governors, as in other colonies, had very
seldom been appointed for them; and it
was their opinion, that these poor people,
should rather be encouraged to settle in
<i>Nova Scotia</i>. They were about <i>three thousand</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in number, with their wives and
children, and might be of service there,
where inhabitants were wanted.</p>

<p>They took into consideration the claim
of property made to stages, &amp;c. in prejudice
of the fishing ships, upon which
<i>Mr. Fane’s</i> opinion had been taken; and
they thought many such titles, if enquired
into, would be found to be defective;
they therefore proposed, that some person,
skilled in the laws, might attend the next
commodore, and assist him to enquire into
them, in behalf of the crown. The
same person might likewise be useful in
forming regulations for the better government
of the inhabitants, during the winter
season, so long as they continue there.
They also recommended, that the bishop
of London, as ordinary of the plantations,
should send a clergyman, whose salary
might be put on the establishment of the
garrison at <i>Placentia</i><a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>This representation of the lords of trade
was taken into consideration at the committee
of council. The committee referred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the board to consider whether, as the commission,
proposed to be given to the <i>Lord
Vere Beauclerck</i>, would vacate his seat in
parliament, the service intended might
not be equally well carried on by <i>instructions</i>
to be given to the <i>Lord Vere Beauclerck</i>,
for putting in execution all the
powers entrusted to the commodore, by stat.
10 &amp; 11 Will. 3. and by a <i>commission</i>, to
be given by his majesty to a person skilled
in the laws, who should accompany the
<i>Lord Vere Beauclerck</i>, for appointing justices
of the peace, and establishing some
form of civil government among the people
who had settled themselves in that
island, that they might not be left in a
state of anarchy, upon the departure of
his majesty’s ships of war. If their lordships
saw no objection thereto, they were
desired to consider of a proper form of
commission and instructions.</p>

<p>They were also desired to consider,
whether it might be adviseable to separate
the government of <i>Placentia</i> from that
of <i>Nova Scotia</i>.</p>

<p>The committee made another order the
19 of April 1729, in which they recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to his majesty all the points proposed
by the lords commissioners of trade.</p>

<p>In obedience to the first order of the
committee of council, the lords report,
that they thought a commission to some
person to attend the <i>Lord Vere Beauclerck</i>,
with proper instructions, might serve instead
of a commission to his lordship.
They prepared a commission and instructions
accordingly, whereby such person
was required to take the advice of <i>Lord
Vere Beauclerck</i>, and to execute such matters
as his lordship should propose to him
in writing, for his majesty’s service.
Among the instructions they inserted some
relative to the acts of trade and navigation;
which, however, their lordships
thought would prove of small effect till
his majesty should be pleased to erect a
court of admiralty, or some other proper
jurisdiction in Newfoundland, to take
cognizance of offences against those acts.</p>

<p>They drew up instructions for <i>Lord
Vere Beauclerck</i>, and made the old heads of
enquiry a part of them.</p>

<p>They remark, that they had added an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
instruction, which required his lordship to
send home all offenders, in robbery, murder,
and felony, and likewise the witnesses,
which had not always been done. This
was to be practised till such time as some
other method should be established for
trying offenders in the country, which
may, say their lordships, perhaps be
thought necessary, so soon as the island
shall have been put under better regulations,
and some person skilled in the laws
may hereafter be annually sent thither for
this purpose, with his majesty’s commission
of oyer and terminer.</p>

<p>They were of opinion that the government
of <i>Placentia</i> should be separated from
that of <i>Nova Scotia</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A civil governor
is appointed.</div>

<p>This design for establishing some sort
of government in Newfoundland ended
in the appointment, not of <i>a person skilled
in the law</i>, but of <i>Captain Henry Osborn</i>,
commander of his majesty’s ship <i>the
Squirrel</i>.</p>

<p>The commission given to Captain Osborn
begins by revoking so much of the
commission to the governor of <i>Nova Scotia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
as related to the government of <i>Placentia</i>,
or any other forts in Newfoundland;
and then goes on to appoint <i>Henry
Osborn governor and commander in chief in
and over our said island of Newfoundland, our
fort and garrison at Placentia, and all other
forts and garrisons erected and to be erected in
that island</i>. It then gives him authority
to administer the oaths to government,
and to appoint justices of the peace, with
other necessary officers and ministers for
the better administration of justice, and
keeping the peace and quiet of the island.
But neither he nor the justices were to
do any thing contrary to the Stat. 10 &amp; 11
Will. 3, nor obstruct the powers thereby
given to the admirals of harbours, or captains
of the ships of war. The justices
were required to be aiding and assisting
to the commodore, or commanders of
the ships of war, and the fishing admirals,
in putting in execution the said statute.
The governor was to erect a court-house
and prison; all officers, civil and military
were to be aiding and assisting to him in
executing this commission. In case of his
death, the government was to devolve on
the first lieutenant of <i>the Oxford</i>, the ship
commanded by <i>Lord Vere Beauclerck</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the terms of the first commission
of civil governor, granted for
Newfoundland. The instructions that accompanied
this commission, have nothing
in them very particular. They are fourteen
in number; and the last required him
to execute all such matters as <i>Lord Vere
Beauclerck</i> should propose to him, for his
majesty’s service. The instructions to his
lordship contained all the <i>heads of enquiry</i>
relating to the trade and finery, and the
abuses and irregularities so long complained
of, and they were fifty in number.</p>

<p>We are told, that on the 24th of May
1729, a box was sent to the <i>Lord Vere Beauclerck</i>,
in which were eleven setts of <i>Shaw’s
Practical Justice of the Peace</i>, each impressed
on the covers, in gold letters, with
one of these titles, <i>Placentia</i>, <i>St. John’s</i>,
<i>Carboneer</i>, <i>Bay of Bulls</i>, <i>St. Mary’s</i>, <i>Trepassey</i>,
<i>Ferryland</i>, <i>Bay de Verd</i>, <i>Trinity Bay</i>, <i>Bonavista</i>,
<i>Old Parlekin</i> <span class="smcap">in Newfoundland</span>;
together with thirteen printed copies of
Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3, and a bundle containing
the acts relating to the trade and
navigation of this kingdom. And thus
provided, his lordship and the governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
set sail for Newfoundland<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, in the summer
of the year 1729.</p>

<p>Having brought down this history to
the period, when an attempt was made
to afford some sort of civil government to
Newfoundland, I shall make a short pause
in the narrative; and call the reader’s attention
to some few documents, that will
more strongly impress upon his mind
the actual state of things in that island,
and the pressing necessity there was for the
interposition of the parliament, or of the
executive government, to correct abuses,
and establish some sort of regular authority.
I have before given a particular account
of the enormities subsisting within
three years after passing Stat. 10 &amp; 11
Will. 3, from a letter written by a person
then confided in by the government at
home; I mean Mr. Larkin<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. It is very
plainly to be collected, from the representation
made by that gentleman, that this
statute was ineffective and inadequate from
the very beginning. What is inapplicable
in its origin, is not likely to become more
useful in a course of time. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
found, in fact, that in all the time that
elapsed between passing that act, and
the year 1729, disorder and anarchy increased
more and more; and nothing remained
but to try another system.</p>

<p>The documents I shall produce will
be extracts from the correspondence and
communications made by the commodores
and commanders on the Newfoundland
station, to the board of trade. In
these it will be seen, what was the nature
of the disorders and irregularities committed
in the island; and it will appear
how very inadequate was the authority
and jurisprudence conferred by the statute
of King William, and how ill the
authority and jurisdiction so given, was
administered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disorders in
Newfoundland,
and conduct of
the fishing admirals
during this
period.</div>

<p>One of the correspondents writes in this
manner.—“The admirals which are appointed
by the Newfoundland act, to decide
differences, in relation to fishing-rooms,
&amp;c. have entirely neglected it in
all its parts. Indeed, at their first arrival,
they claim their prerogative, as by the
said act, as far as it suits with their own
interest and no further; except a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
friend of theirs should arrive with a
fishing ship; in such case should the ships
fishing rooms of that harbour be taken up
before he arrives, they often remove some
planter or other for him, pretending that
the planter’s title is not good to the room
he possesses, when the commanders of men
of war, some years before, adjudged it to
be the said planter’s right.”</p>

<p>“These things are often done, and several
of the inhabitants’ fishing voyages
ruined thereby. It is common, that what is
done one year, in relation to fishing rooms,
is contradicted the next; so that the fishing-rooms,
are not settled to this very day.
Many times these <i>admirals</i> never were in
the land before, nor knew any thing of
the matter; in which case some old west
country master commonly takes care that
the said admiral do nothing but what he
pleases.—Those are the patrons that are
commonly called <i>kings</i> in that country,
who sacrifice other people’s interest frequently
to serve their own. The admirals
are some of the first men to cut down
the roofs of their stages, cook-rooms, and
flakes, which paves the way for the inhabitants
to follow their example, who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the winter season generally carry away all
the remainder. It is certain the admirals
are seldom or never at leisure to hear any
complaints whatsoever, except one of
their favourites is the plaintiff<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.”</p>

<p>“The masters of ships in Newfoundland
generally endeavour to force their goods
upon the inhabitants, especially the poorer
sort, who generally pay dearest. Say they,
if he makes a good voyage, we shall be
all paid; and if he does not (says every
one to himself) I will be quick enough to
get my payment. By this means they have
a jealous eye, the one over the other. If
the fishing does not prove so good as was
expected, some of these matters will fall
upon them, before the fishing season is
half over, take away their fish before half
made; another comes and takes away his
train; and many times there comes a third,
who has more men than they, and takes
it away from the former; he that has most
men is sure to have the greatest share.
This is a common practice in Newfoundland.
They never acquaint the admirals
with this proceeding before they do it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
neither do the admirals trouble themselves
with it afterwards. But the consequence
lies here; the planters’ men will catch no
more fish, because they have no hopes of
getting any wages; the planter is ruined,
and all the rest of the creditors unpaid;
who, if they had given him the liberty to
make his fishing-voyage, might have paid
them all. The merchants of England have
suffered exceedingly by this unparalleled
thing, there being no precedent for it in the
whole Christian world. I am fully satisfied
that by this thing, and the multiplicity
of liquors imported into Newfoundland
yearly, the trade thereof has suffered more,
than by the French plundering it so often
in the late wars.”</p>

<p>“It is most certain that the admirals in
Newfoundland have <i>never</i> taken any care
about the good of that trade; and their
reasons generally given for it are, that
they come to Newfoundland to mind
their owner’s business; and as nothing was
allowed them for defraying the charges of
keeping courts, they could not do it<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Another writes thus.—“But what I would
more particularly represent to their lordships,
is the clandestine and illegal commerce
carried on between the <i>New England
men</i>, and several of the British masters,
especially the fishing admirals; who after
they have, according to the act, qualified
themselves in England for fishing ships,
depart for <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, or <i>Portugal</i>,
where they freight with wines and brandies;
which early in the year they carry
directly to Newfoundland; and either dispose
of to the planters, or barter with the
New England-men for the produce of the
plantations. By these means Newfoundland
is not only supplied with these foreign
European commodities, but it is become a
mart, from whence other American plantations
are (in fraud of his majesty’s duties)
in a good measure furnished.”</p>

<p>“As the admirals are chiefly concerned
in this unfair trade, so their tyranny and
oppression in the harbours, where there
are none of his majesty’s ships, is not to
be reckoned amongst the least causes of
the decay of the fishery; those who labor
in it, having learnt by experience, that the
rule of their decision is their private interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and that fishermen are not to expect
any justice from them. This contributes
to a scarcity of men, which occasions
wages to be so extravagant, that the fish
which they catch is often not sufficient to
pay the servants. And the inhabitants are
thereby so much discouraged, that there
have not been half the number of boats
employed by them as formerly.”</p>

<p>“But whatever redress the corrupt administration
of the admirals is capable of,
another great disadvantage, which the
fishery labors under, proceeds from the
country being, during its long winter,
without the least form of government or
order. It is my humble opinion, that it
would be of considerable service to it, if
some of the inhabitants were intrusted
with commissions of the peace for the
administration of justice during that season<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.”</p>

<p>Another writes—“I flattered myself that
as there was no garrison here (namely at <i>St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
John’s</i>) to terrify or interfere, I should
find a stricter obedience to the laws and
regulations that had been made for the
government of the place; and that proper
regard was shewn to the authority
vested by law in the fishing admirals;
but on the contrary I find, that
through the ignorance of some, and negligence
of more, for some years past,
they have been so slighted, that unless the
captains of the men of war are present
to assist and countenance them at their
courts, their meetings would be nothing
but confusion, and their orders of no use,
which is the reason we are obliged <i>to usurp</i>
power, which, I apprehend, does not
properly belong to us, of publishing orders
in our own names; to prevent, as
much as we can, the threats, the rioting,
and disorders, which, to the great detriment
of the fishery, are generally practised
in our absence.”</p>

<p>“The great misfortune, and which I think
is the origin of all the rest that attend this
country, is, that no body in the winter season
is empowered to keep peace, and administer
justice; that the sober and industrious
are every day liable to be insulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and robbed by the idle and profligate,
unless they can oppose them with greater
force. In the <i>heads of inquiry</i> from the
lords commissioners for trade and plantations,
there is an article which directs,
the names of the persons to be returned
them, who administered justice during the
last winter; but I cannot find that we are
any where authorized so to empower proper
persons upon leaving the country; which
is so well known by every body, that
were we to pretend to appoint any body,
not the least regard would be shewn
them.”</p>

<p>Speaking of <i>Placentia</i>, and the part surrendered
by the French at the treaty of
<i>Utrecht</i>; he says,—“Before the arrival of
the men of war, they are threatened and
intimidated into a compliance with whatever
is required of them; the admiral’s
powers are contemned; their court represented
as ridiculous and invalid, and of
course, no justice to be had. But as this
has been already represented by petition
from the masters of ships, and other methods,
I will not take up your time by
enumerating more particulars, which would
only be a repetition of what is already sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
known to their lordships. Although
I could not settle every thing in
the order it ought to be, I endeavoured to
do all I could; and as I found the regard
to the fishing admirals so mightily diminished,
as made me justly apprehend,
orders from them would be but negligently
obeyed, I therefore gave out in my name,
such as I found absolutely necessary, the
copies of which I have herewith sent; and
have also entered them in a book, which I
have left sealed up with one of the principal
inhabitants, to be delivered to the next
officer that shall come after me, that he
may know what I did, and my reasons for
so doing. I beg leave to say, that if such
a register of the proceedings of every officer
had been kept ever since we had possession
of the place, it would not be so difficult to
decide every one’s property; which really,
as things were, I could not pretend to do,
without running a risk of doing injustice.”</p>

<p>“I found disputes had been very differently
decided; sometimes according to the
laws and customs that were in force in the
time of the French, and sometimes according
to those observed in the other parts of
Newfoundland. For no new act having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
passed since the acquisition of the place,
and no certain rules presented by <i>the heads
of inquiry</i> from the lords of trade, every
one has decided as he thought proper<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.”</p>

<p>Another says, “there is another great
occasion of disorder, which always stores up
large stock of complaints, to perplex us
upon our arrival—the neglect of deputing
some body to maintain order in the winter, or
the want of power rather to depute some body
for that purpose; so that the winter
season is a sort of respite from all observance
of law or government. At that time,
theft, murder, rapes, or disorders of any
kind whatsoever, may be committed, and
most of them are committed without controul,
and time enough given for the offender
to make off: for should any one
concern himself to secure the party, his
design would be withstood, as an usurped
authority; and most would take part with
the offender, to suppress the usurpation,
without regard what became of the criminal,
or what may be the consequence of
the crime; and I have been acquainted
with some cases of this kind: so that there
seems an absolute necessity, that this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
should be provided for, that people
may always have somebody to apply to
for justice; that somebody may always be
at hand to suppress disorder and riot, and
to have a lawful power to command the
assistance of his majesty’s subjects in the
execution of a duty exercised for the public
good. <i>St. John’s</i> is the metropolis of
the island, and the discipline which is kept
up there, whether bad or good, will have
a great influence upon all the rest of the
harbours. If good order could be established
here, it might easily be effected in
all other places; and I do not know any
thing that tends more to confusion, and
proves more prejudicial to the fishery, than
that irregularity.”</p>

<p>After having spoken of the oppression
from debts, the imposition in prices, the
seizing for payment, and the like, he goes
on—“It is likewise necessary to acquaint
their lordships, that although it is reasonable
for them to believe, that the authority
given by the statute to the admirals of
harbours, is sufficient to secure them peace
and quietness, and to prevent any disturbances
that may happen, to the detriment
of the fishery, yet the experience of any
one that has but once known this trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
will affirm, that was it not for the yearly
expectation of a ship of war coming among
them, the power of their admirals would
be of little regard; so that one may modestly
affirm, they only commence regulation
upon the arrival of any of his majesty’s
ships, and lay it down the moment they
are gone; upon which account several go
and come with the trade, which charge, I
believe, they would gladly be freed from,
could they be secure of good order in the
winter<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.”</p>

<p>Another writes, “I have made it my particular
care to inform myself about the government,
<i>that</i> being the material and only
thing wanting: for without that there is
nothing; and with that, I mean a good
government, there would be every thing—it
would give a new life and spirit to every
thing; for then every man would know
his own, and no more; every one would
know his master, and obey; and every one
would know his servant, and no more;
every servant would do his master’s work,
and every master would pay his servants’
wages without fraud; he would know his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
own pile of fish, his boat, his stage, his
nets, &amp;c. But on the foot it is now on, he
that happens to be the strongest, knows
every thing to be his own, and the weakest
knows nothing, or had as good as know
nothing, except in that little interval of
time when his majesty’s ship, or ships,
happen to be there; and very often the
aggressor absconds, runs into the woods,
and flies from justice, until the ships are
gone; and then down he comes, and reigns
lord again. This has been done by a great
many, but especially by one <i>Ford</i>, who had
a power left him by a commander of one
of his majesty’s ships to be governor of
<i>Petty Harbour</i>. I have seen, and heard
so very much of this, that I faithfully believe,
and I have done myself the honour
in two letters to my lords of trade, to acquaint
them, as I here do, that no man living
in the country of Newfoundland is fit
to govern. For the set of people that
live here, are those that cannot live in
Great Britain, or any where else, but in a
place without government; and it is my
opinion, without there is a <i>governor</i>, a man
of honour and justice sent to Newfoundland,
I mean a <i>civil governor</i>, that shall not
reside altogether at one place, but must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a sloop, or some embarkation, to transport
him from cove to cove, and set order and
rule amongst them, the fishery and trade
to that place must fall in a little time.”</p>

<p>“I have given out several orders for the
admirals, and the oldest masters and planters
to survey the stages and cook-rooms,
&amp;c. to know what belong to ship-rooms,
and what was boat-rooms; and their
report to me was, that they had not been
surveyed so long, that there was none,
either admirals, masters, or inhabitants,
knew one from another; which was the
best, and all that I could get on that head<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.”</p>

<p>Again—“for the most part the admirals
are for their own private benefit, and not
the public good, in general; they have
some privileges more than the others, and
especially in collecting their debts due to
themselves, and very little else is minded of
the act of parliament, relating to the admirals
of the harbours, if they are not
compelled by the commanders of his majesty’s
ships of war, and all this is for want
of a governor on the spot. The admirals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
determine differences, and very often they
appeal to the commanders of his majesty’s
ships for a final determination; but stand
by that no longer than while the captain
is on the spot<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.”</p>

<p>Another writes, “I had several complaints
from the inhabitants and others,
of injustice done them by the <i>admirals</i>,
<i>vice-admirals</i>, &amp;c. of their taking their fish
off the rocks before cured, and other goods,
for debts by them contracted, without any
law or justice, which has been a common
thing amongst them; so that they wholly
ruin the fishery, for the planters have nothing
to work with next year. These
things are done by masters of ships,
when the admiral has been in harbour,
without his order. By this irregular proceeding
the strongest man gets all, and the
rest of the creditors nothing; so that the
next year a planter is forced to hire himself
out for a servant.”</p>

<p>Again—“as for the people complaining
to admirals of any injustice done them by
others, I do not find that any master of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
ship values him, but the strongest side takes
away every thing by force<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>”.</p>

<p>Another writes, “the admirals prove
generally the greatest knaves, and do most
prejudice, being both judge and party, in
hearing suits for debt; and when they
have saved themselves, then they will do
justice to others: so it would be requisite
to have a civil government, and persons
appointed to administer justice in the most
populous and frequented places, that they
may be governed as Britons, and not live
like a banditti or forsaken people, without
law or gospel, having no means of religion,
there being but one clergyman in all the
country<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.”</p>

<p>While the king’s officers, and persons
employed and trusted by the government,
were making such uniform complaints
of the abuses and disorders in the
government of Newfoundland, the merchants
adventurers seem to have been
wholly blind to these irregularities. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
several representations and memorials from
them, sent in consequence of letters from
the board of trade, written in the year
1715, there are complaints of grievances,
but those were quite of a different sort;
and if <i>they</i> were removed, they appear
to have been wholly unconcerned as to the
continuance of those we have just been recounting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complaints
from the Merchants.</div>

<p>They complain of the great quantities of
liquor and tobacco, which had paid no
duty, and were imported by the <i>New England-men</i>,
whereby the fishermen were debauched,
and the fishery generally hindered;
that the New England ships enticed
away the seamen, and were encouraged
thereto by a premium of forty shillings
per head, given by the government
of New England for bringing seamen and
fishermen. They prayed that all import
of liquor and tobacco, except from Great
Britain, should be prohibited, and the
articles forfeited; and that the fishing admirals
should have power to seize, and to
have half the forfeiture.</p>

<p>They prayed, that all store-houses, &amp;c.
built by planters since 1685, in the front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fishing ships’ rooms, towards the water,
should be declared by act of parliament to
belong to the ship to which the fishing
room belonged—this to be enforced by
forfeitures, to be levied by the fishing admirals.
For better preservation of store-houses,
cook-rooms, stages, &amp;c. &amp;c. they prayed
that the fishing admirals, at the end of the
season, should inspect them all, and depute
some honest and best inhabitant of the harbour,
to take care that no one presumed
to demolish or injure them; and that such
person so deputed should receive twenty shillings
from the fishing ship which occupied
it next season.</p>

<p>They propose some strict regulations,
to prevent aliens and strangers sending
out ships as English owned; with a
power to the fishing admirals to administer
an oath to the masters of ships, as to
the ownership; and to seize, as forfeited,
all foreign ships; half the forfeiture to go
to the person seizing.</p>

<p>They complain, that the French parts
were not so open for fishing ships to get
rooms as they should be, <i>Governor Moody</i>
and others pretending to have bought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
French plantations; that the governor had
permitted French ships to come, and had
taken all power out of the hands of the
fishing admirals.</p>

<p>In order that the poor labouring fishermen
might not suffer oppression and disturbance
from any military, or public officer,
soldier, they desired, that no military person,
on any pretence whatsoever, should intermeddle
with the fishery or fishermen, inhabitants,
or others; nor should let the soldiers
out to hire, nor keep suttling houses,
nor have, for their private use, any house
out of the lines of the fortification, or any
gardens that have served, or may serve,
for fishing rooms, according to the
judgment of the fishing admirals of the
harbour.</p>

<p>And because the commodores of late
years had taken upon them to keep courts,
and send warrants to several remote harbours,
for commanders of fishing ships, in
the height of the season, upon frivolous
complaints of idle and debauched men, and
others, without the complaint being first
heard by the fishing admirals, according to
act of parliament, to the great prejudice of the
fishery—they prayed, that the commodore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
might not in future be permitted to do the
like; that all complaints might be decided
by the fishing admirals, and that no commodore
should presume to intermeddle with
debts between merchants, masters, planters,
and fishermen, as they had lately done,
to the great prejudice of the merchants.
They pray, that the ships of war, which
were there to project the trade, might be
obliged to come or send assistance, in case
of piracy or mutiny in any of the harbours.</p>

<p>They pray, that none should retail liquors
to fishermen, or persons concerned in the
fishery, but only to their own servants;
that goods, the produce or manufacture
of Great Britain, might be exported duty
free, for the benefit of the fishery; that all
oil, blubber, furs, and fish, taken or made
in Newfoundland by British subjects, might
be imported duty free, and that Mediterranean
passes for the ships carrying fish
might be given gratis.</p>

<p>They pray, that fishermen should be
obliged to fish till the last day of August,
if required by their masters. The usual
day had been the 20th of August; but the
fish now came later. That fishing admirals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
should have power to give corporal
punishment to all persons, of what degree
soever, who profaned the Lord’s-day, and
all common drunkards, swearers, and lewd
persons; that a sufficient number of ministers
should be sent to the principal harbours,
to instruct the inhabitants; and that
they might be paid from England, the
country being very poor<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>Others represented, that it would be
proper to add penalties to stat. 10 and 11
Will. 3.; that masters of ships should
give bond to bring back such persons as
they carried out; or, if they went to a
foreign market, to procure others to do it;
that bye boat-keepers should give bond to
return and bring back all their servants and
hired men, with the like proviso, in case
of going to a foreign market; that masters
coming from any place but Great Britain,
should give bond not to take away any
fishermen or seamen—the penalty to be
fixed by the fishing admirals; that seamen,
or fishermen, who refused to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
home, should forfeit all their wages; that
no master of a ship, bye boat-keeper, or
other person, going or trading to Newfoundland,
should give credit to any servant
or fisherman to more than forty shillings;
nor any other person selling liquor
to more than five shillings; that a debenture,
or bounty, be allowed on all beef
and pork, as if exported for sale; and also
for all bread, flour, and malt, that should be
shipped off in fishing ships bound for Newfoundland<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.
To these particulars were
added the same complaints about foreigners
interloping in the fishery, as in the former
memorials. The mayor of Plymouth, in
answer to the same sort of letter from the
board, says, that the merchants had no
other complaint to make than the encroachments
of foreigners<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>Such were the representations made by
the officers of the crown on one hand, and
by the merchants on the other, respecting
the trade and government of the island. I
have delivered them in their own words,
and the reader will decide between them.</p>

<p>Some hope might reasonably be entertained,
that the establishment of a civil
government, and the appointment of justices
of the peace, with proper officers for
executing the law, would have been received
by all as a desirable improvement
in the state of society in the island, and
it might be expected, that such an appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
could not fail of its effect. But
the cause which had always operated to
prevent any sufficient authority being introduced
into that place, opposed itself
to this new establishment. The <i>western
merchants</i>, who had been silent, while this
measure was in agitation, were ready
enough to bring complaints of its consequences,
when carried into execution;
and we shall soon see the struggle made to
prevent any lawful authority taking root
an Newfoundland.</p>

<p>The government soon had to regret,
that they had not taken the advice of the
board of trade, to bring forward a bill in
parliament for correcting all the abuses,
then subsisting there; for it will be found
that the opposition raised against the civil
governor and his justices, was on account
of their not deriving their authority from
parliament, but only from the king in
council. How futile soever this reason
may be, it had its effect in staggering
many, and contributing to bring the office,
and persons bearing it, into great
question, if not contempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Justices appointed.</div>

<p><i>Mr. Osborn</i>, upon his arrival, proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to carry into execution his commission.
He divided the island into convenient districts,
and appointed in each of them, out
of the inhabitants and planters of the best
character, such a number of <i>justices of the
peace</i> and constables, as seemed necessary.
In order for building a prison, he ordered
a rate, such as the justices represented, he
says, to him as of little burthen to be
raised, within the districts of <i>St. John’s</i>,
and <i>Ferryland</i>; and a prison was to be
built in each of those places. It was not
greater than half a quintal of merchantable
fish per boat, and half a quintal for every
boats’-room, including the ships-rooms of
ships fishing on the bank, that had no boats;
with the like proportionable rate upon
such persons in trade as were not concerned
in the fishery; this rate was only
for one fishing season. He erected several
pair of stocks, and he expressed a hope
that the measures he had taken would be
sufficient to suppress the great disorders
that had so long prevailed.</p>

<p>But he says he most feared, that as the
best of the magistrates were but mean
people, and not used to be subject to any
government, they would be obedient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
orders given them, no longer than they
had a superior amongst them. He says,
that he and <i>Lord Vere</i> had done many acts
of justice to the inhabitants and planters,
particularly at <i>Placentia</i>, where they restored
several plantations that <i>Colonel Gledhill</i> had
unjustly possessed for several years; and
many more might have been taken from
that officer, had the real proprietors been
on the spot to sue for them<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion on raising
money by
the justices.</div>

<p>When <i>Lord Vere</i>, and <i>Mr. Osborn</i>, returned
to England, they made a report of
what they had done; in order to be ascertained
of the ground on which they
acted, they wished the opinion of the law-officers
might be taken on some points,
and four questions were accordingly referred
to the attorney-general, then <i>Sir
Philip Yorke</i>. The main point was the
levying money for building the prisons;
and the attorney-general was clearly of
opinion that the justices of the peace in
Newfoundland had not sufficient authority
to raise money for building a <i>prison</i>,
by laying a tax upon fish caught, or upon
fishing-boats; the rather because Stat. 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
&amp; 11 Will. 3. directs that it shall be a
free trade. The power of justices of the
peace in England for building gaols depends,
says he, upon Stat. 11 &amp; 12 Will.
3, c. 19. by which they are enabled to
make an assessment upon the several divisions
of their respective counties, after
a presentment made by the grand jury at
the assizes, great sessions, or general gaol
delivery. As the justices of peace were
by their commissions, to act according to
the law of England, he apprehended they
ought to have pursued that act of parliament
as nearly as the circumstances of the
case would admit, and to have laid the
tax, after a presentment by some grand
jury; and then it should have been laid
upon the <i>inhabitants</i>, and not upon the <i>fish</i>
or <i>fishing-boats</i>. So far as the people had
submitted to this tax, there might, he
said, be no occasion to call it in question;
but he could not advise the taking of rigorous
methods to compel a compliance
with it.</p>

<p>As to assaulting any of the justices or
constables, or any resistance to their authority;
that, says he, might be punished
by indictment, fine, and imprisonment at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the quarter sessions; and for contemptuous
words spoken of the justices or their
authority, such offenders could only be
bound to their good behaviour. Destroying
the stocks or whipping-posts
were indictable offences. He was of opinion
the justices could not decide differences
relating to property, their power
being restrained wholly to the criminal
matters mentioned in their commission.</p>

<p>He thought neither <i>Captain Osborn</i>, nor
the justices had power to raise any tax for
<i>repairing churches</i>, or any other public
work, except such works for which power
was given to justices of the peace in
England to levy money, by particular
acts of parliament<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fane</i> was likewise consulted upon
these points, and was of the same opinion;
however he adds, for their lordship’s consideration,
admitting the Stat. 11 &amp; 12
Will. 3. had not been strictly pursued, yet
as the assessment of fish was equally laid,
as the people had submitted to it, as no
other way could be thought of for raising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the tax; and as his majesty’s commission
would be intirely ineffectual, unless a
gaol was built, whether any inconvenience
could arise, if upon the refusal of
any of the persons assessed, the method
laid down by Stat. 11 &amp; 12 Will. 3. were
pursued to compel a compliance with it<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.
Upon being again consulted, he says,
he thought <i>Captain Osborn</i>, as he had
acted with so much caution and prudence,
and had taken no arbitrary step, in execution
of his commission, could not be liable
to a prosecution in England, in case the
inhabitants should not acquiesce in the
tax. He thought it absolutely necessary
the tax should be levied according to the
Stat. 11 &amp; 12 Will. 3. and notwithstanding
the proceeding already had was not
entirely agreeable to that law, he thought
<i>Captain Osborn</i> would be very well justified
in pursuing it, as it seemed the only method
whereby the design of his majesty’s
commission could be executed<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contest between
the justices and
fishing admirals.</div>

<p>Such were the discussions raised on the
occasion of these attempts to improve the
police of the island. <i>Mr. Osborn</i> again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
went to Newfoundland: but in a letter
from St. John’s in September 1730, he
gives a very bad account of the new institution.
He says, he had hoped that a
proper submission and respect would have
been paid to the orders he had given,
and to the magistrates he had appointed;
but instead thereof, the <i>fishing admirals</i>,
and some of the rest of the masters of
ships and traders in the island had ridiculed
the justices’ authority very much, and
had used their utmost endeavours to lessen
them in the eyes of the lower sort of
people, and in some parts had, in a manner,
wrested their power from them. The
admirals had brought the powers given
them by the fishing act in competition
with that of the justices, and had not
even scrupled to touch upon that of the
<i>governor</i>. All this discord proceeded from
a jealousy the admirals and the rest of the
masters of ships had conceived, that their
privileges granted them by Stat. 10 &amp; 11
Will. 3. were invaded by these magistrates;
which power, says he, “those admirals
could hardly ever be brought to make
use of (without it was to serve their own
purposes) before, nor till they saw these
officers established; and they are now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
adds the governor, doing all they can
against these men, only because they bear
this commission. Indeed, says he, I find
by their will, they would be sole rulers,
and have nobody to controul them in
their arbitrary proceedings. He expostulated
with them, but it seemed to serve no
other purpose than to raise their resentment
against him, as the abettor of the
justices. He could not charge the justices
with having taken any arbitrary steps;
their fault was rather the contrary, whereas
the admirals were guilty of many.”</p>

<p>“The commission of the peace was in
general disliked by all the <i>masters of ships</i>,
who were the chief people that opposed
most of the steps the governor had taken;
for which reason, and partly from the indifference
of some of the justices, in their
offices, who thought they suffered in their
way of trade, and got the ill will of the
people they dealt with, and partly from
the incapacity of others, the commissions
of the peace were but indifferently executed.
However the governor, notwithstanding
this opposition, proceeded to
make appointments in places where he
had before made none.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>prison</i> and <i>court house</i> at St. John’s
were nearly finished, and people had very
well complied with the rate. He agreed
to a presentment for a rate to build a prison
at <i>Ferryland</i>; and he said, he did not
doubt but the very sight of these two prisons
would, in some measure, check many
people in their evil courses<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.</p>

<p>Memorials were presented to the governor,
by the justices of <i>St. John’s</i>, complaining
that they were obstructed in their
duty by the fishing admirals, who had
taken upon them the whole power and authority
of the justices, bringing under their
cognizance all riots, breaches of the peace,
and other offences, and had seized, fined,
and whipped at their pleasure; they had
likewise appointed public-houses to sell
liquor, without any licence from the justices;
the admirals told the justices, <i>they</i>
were only <i>winter justices</i>, and seemed to
doubt of the governor’s authority for appointing;
that the authority of the admirals
was by act of parliament—the <i>governor’s</i>
only from the privy council<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. This
distinction in the authority from whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they derived their power, was thought
sufficient for the admirals to presume upon;
and the comparative pretensions of
them and the justices were rated accordingly
in the minds of the ignorant and
malicious<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>The towns in the west were not backward
to join in this clamour against the
justices; they complained that the governor
had taken the power out of the hands
of the fishing admirals, and vested it in
the justices, who had proceeded in an arbitrary
way to tax the servants and inhabitants;
had issued out their warrants not
only against servants, but against the masters
of vessels themselves, in the midst of
their fishery; to their great prejudice, and
in defiance of the admirals and the act of
parliament. They suggested that these
justices were, some of them New England
men; and none of them ever coming
to England, as the admirals did, there
was no redress to be obtained against them
for their illegal proceedings. They
said, some of the justices supplied the
fishermen and seamen with liquor at exorbitant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
rates, though the merchants would
supply them at a moderate advance. After
stating such plausible topics, which,
it was well known, would always be listened
to when Newfoundland was in
question; they prayed, “That such justices
might have no power during the
stay of the fishing ships; but that the
admirals might resume their authority,
and that the commodore and captains of
men of war should be ordered to be aiding
and assisting to them therein<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion on the
authority of the
admirals.</div>

<p>This competition between the fishing
admirals and the justices was taken into
consideration by the board of trade, who
called for the opinion of <i>Sir Philip Yorke</i>,
then attorney-general, and he reported,
that upon a view of the commission to
the justices, of Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3. and
of all the complaints, it appeared to him
the whole authority granted to the fishing
admirals was restrained to seeing the rules
and orders contained in that act, concerning
the regulation of the fishery, duly
put in execution; and to the determination
of differences arising between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
masters of fishing boats, and the inhabitants,
or any bye boat-keepers, touching
the right and property of fishing-rooms,
stages, flakes, &amp;c. which was a sort of
civil jurisdiction in particular cases of
property; whereas the authority of justices
extended only to breaches of the
peace. He was therefore of opinion, that
the powers granted to the justices were
not inconsistent with any of the provisions
of the act, and that there was no interfering
between the powers given by the act to
the admirals, and those by the commission
to the justices<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p>The struggle between the fishing admirals
and the justices was still kept up;
the west country merchants, and masters
of ships supporting the former, and the
governor standing by the latter. This
produced complaints on both sides; and
no doubt, in such a contest a just cause of
complaint might often be found on both
sides. But the aggressors were certainly
those who set themselves against the authority
of the governor and justices, and
who, by their conduct on this occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
plainly shewed they wished the inhabitants
and poor planters should be deprived
of all protection from legal government,
and should be left wholly at <i>their</i> mercy.</p>

<p>It was given in special charge to the
succeeding governor, <i>Captain Clinton</i>, and
to his successors, to make a report of what
was done towards carrying into execution
the new commission of the peace. In
compliance with that charge, we find
the governors return such accounts of the
opposition of these admirals to the civil
government, as are hardly to be credited
but by those who have read what went
before; and after that it would be tiresome
and nauseous to detail any more upon
the subject<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. This contest continued
for some years, till it was found
that no opposition could induce his majesty’s
ministers to withdraw this small
portion of civil government, which had
not been granted till it had been loudly
called for by the necessities of the island.
The fishing admirals then became as
quiet, and useless as before, and contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
themselves with minding their own
business, in going backwards and forwards
to the banks.</p>

<p>While this question of the competition
between the fishing admirals, and the
justices, was agitated, <i>Mr. Fane</i> also was
consulted, respecting the distinct jurisdiction
of these officers, and he agreed in
opinion with the attorney-general; he also
at the same time delivered an opinion that
is worth remembering; namely, that all
the statute laws made here, previous to his
majesty’s subjects settling in Newfoundland
are in force there; it being a settlement
in an infidel country; but that as
to the laws passed here, subsequent to the
settlement, he thought they would not
extend to that country, unless it was particularly
noticed<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. The question then
will be, <i>when</i> did this settlement take
place? And it may be urged, that the
policy having all along been to prevent
settlement, and that persons should resort
thither only for the fishing season, there
is to this purpose a settlement commencing
annually; and that in truth, British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
subjects carry with them the laws of this
country, as often as they go thither; if so,
all the law of England, as far as it is applicable
to the state and circumstances of
Newfoundland, is constitutionally and legally
of force there. This was a question
of much importance, but it has since been
settled by the wording of the act of last
session for establishing a court there;
which court is to determine according to
the law of England, as far as the same
is applicable to the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A commission
of oyer and terminer
proposed.</div>

<p>Nothing material appears respecting the
civil government of Newfoundland, till
the year 1737, when the board of trade
listened to the representation that had
frequently been made by the governor, of
the inconvenience of sending over to
England for trial, persons who had committed
capital felonies. In such cases the
witnesses were glad to keep out of the
way; the felon was sent to England, without
any person to prove his guilt; a great
expence was incurred, justice was disappointed;
or if the fact were proved, the
poor witnesses was left to get back as
they could, with the expence of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
voyage and residence, and the certain loss
of one season’s fishing.</p>

<p>It had been provided by stat. 10 and 11
Will. 3. that such capital felonies might be
tried in any county in England; and in the
commission of the peace lately given, this
policy was so closely adhered to, that the
justices were therein restrained from proceeding
<i>in cases of doubt and difficulty, such
as robberies, murders, and felonies, and all
other capital offences</i>. It appeared to the
board of trade that this scruple might now
be got over; and they proposed inserting
in the commission that was to be given to
<i>Captain Vanbrugh</i>, a clause, authorising him
to appoint <i>commissioners of Oyer and Terminer</i>;
but the board wishing to be assured that
the king’s prerogative was not restrained
in this particular, by the above provision
in stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. they consulted
the attorney and solicitor general, who
thought the king’s power was not abridged
by that act. The board, in their representation
to his majesty, state the example
of a commission being granted to the commodores
with other persons, for trials of
piracy, as a precedent for trusting them
with this authority to issue commissions for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
trying felons; and that it was no more than
was given to other governors of plantations.
But they inform his majesty, that as this
power might be too much to be entrusted
in the hands of judges and juries very little
skilled in such proceedings, they had added
an article, which restrained the governor
from allowing more than one court of Oyer
and Terminer in a year, and that only when
he was resident; and he was further instructed,
not to suffer any sentence to be
executed, till report thereof be made to
his majesty<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. But when the commission
went before the privy council for approbation,
all that part which gave this authority
was directed to be left out; so fearful were
they of trusting such authority to those in
whom they had lodged the civil government
of the island<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Such Commission
issued.</div>

<p>So this point rested till the year 1750;
when <i>Captain Rodney</i>, who was then governor,
pressed the secretary of state for
such a power to be granted. It was referred
to the board of trade, where they recurred
to what was projected in the year
1738 for <i>Captain Vanbrugh’s</i> commission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
A doubt arose with the board, whether this
power might be given by <i>instruction</i>, or
whether it must be inserted in the commission;
and <i>Sir D. Ryder</i>, then attorney-general,
being consulted, he was of opinion,
that such power could not be granted
by instruction, nor any otherwise than
under the great seal; but that the manner
of exercising such power might be prescribed
by instruction; he thought the
clause drawn for the commission of 1738
was sufficient, only that neither the power
of trying, nor that of pardoning <i>treason</i>,
should be entrusted with the governor, or
any court erected by him. The commission
issued accordingly, with this new
power, to <i>Captain Francis William Drake</i><a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.</p>

<p>It may be remarked of this commission of
Oyer and Terminer, issued under the new
power given to the governor, that it has
not been executed without some question
being raised as to its legality. Persons,
who were obstinately bent to believe
there was no law in Newfoundland but
stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. were disposed to
doubt the power of the crown to give authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for issuing this, as well as the commission
of the peace. It has been the interest
and inclination of many at Newfoundland
to contest every thing that was
not founded upon the same parliamentary
authority as stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. But
this spirit, whether of ignorance or wilfulness,
has worn off, in a great measure, of
late years, though it is occasionally at work
even now. And it is to be lamented at
this moment, that the advice given by the
board of trade in the year 1718, and afterwards
on the occasion of establishing the
civil government in 1728, was not followed;
and an act of parliament passed for remedying
all the abuses and irregularities at once,
instead of resorting to the half measure that
was then adopted, and which had all the
difficulty we have seen to support itself.</p>

<p>If we are to judge from the dearth of
matter in the books of the board of trade,
things went on very quietly at Newfoundland
for several years. We only find some
scattered facts of no great importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Baltimore
revives his
Claim.</div>

<p>In the year 1754, <i>Lord Baltimore</i> laid in
his claim to be put in possession of a large
tract of land in the island, by the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<i>the province of Avalon</i>, and of all the royal
jurisdictions and prerogatives thereto belonging,
and prayed that his majesty would
approve <i>John Bradstreet, Esq.</i> as governor
thereof. This grant has been before mentioned<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.
A claim so important was referred
by the board of trade to the attorney and
solicitor general; who, after inspection of
such papers as were furnished by the board,
and hearing what could be urged by Lord
Baltimore, were of opinion, that as, notwithstanding
the determination in 1660 in
favour of the grant in 1623, there was no
evidence of any actual possession of the
province, nor the exercise of any powers of
government there by the Baltimore family;
as, on the contrary, it was most probable,
that, at least from 1638, they had been out
of possession; as from the year 1669 there
had been many proceedings, which appeared
from the books of the board of
trade, and even an act of parliament passed
in the 10 and 11 Will. 3. inconsistent with
the right now set up, without taking the
least notice thereof, and without any claim
or interposition on the part of the Baltimore
family; and as his majesty’s approbation
of a governor ought to be in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of a clear title of proprietorship,
they were of opinion, his majesty should not
comply with the petition. This opinion
of the law officers seems to have been
adopted by the board, and no more has
since been heard of the province of <i>Avalon</i><a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<p>The board of trade in November 1758,
shewed a disposition to take into consideration
the trade and fishery of Newfoundland,
which were then said <i>to have declined of late
years</i>. For the purpose of obtaining every
information that could be derived from
those experienced and interested in the question,
they directed letters to be written to
the towns in the west; but they received
for answer nothing but such matter as had
relation to the inconveniences resulting to
the trade from a state of war; and the only
remedies proposed were a due regulation
of convoys, and that seamen employed in
that trade should not be subject to pressing<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Peace
1763.</div>

<p>After the conclusion of the peace in
1763, a more favourable opportunity
seemed to present itself for doing something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
towards the encouragement of the
fishery. Upon this occasion, as upon former
ones, when this subject was under deliberation,
the board of trade called upon
the western towns for advice and information;
and now they joined to them such
towns in <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Scotland</i> as had lately
engaged in that trade; namely, <i>Cork</i>,
<i>Waterford</i>, <i>Belfast</i>, and <i>Glasgow</i>.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The French turned their attention to the
arrangements to be made in their own
fishery, in consequence of the peace. The
French ambassador presented to our court
a project of arrangement, to be reciprocally
agreed upon between the two crowns,
for avoiding disturbance and dispute between
the English and French in carrying
on the concurrent fishery. This matter
came before the board of trade, who referred
it to <i>Sir George Hay</i>, the king’s advocate,
and <i>Sir Fletcher Norton</i>, and <i>Mr. de
Grey</i>, the attorney and solicitor general,
for their opinion, whether the project was
consistent with stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3.?
and whether the crown could legally enter
into, and had power to enforce such regulations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
so far as they related to the subjects
of Great Britain? To which they
answered, that the project contained many
things contrary to the act, as well in respect
of the rights of the king’s subjects, as to
the mode of determining controversies
arising there; and that the crown had no
power to enter into, or enforce such regulations<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>It was, however, thought proper to draw
up some <i>additional instructions</i> to the governor,
with a view of preventing any interruption
or disturbance being given by
the English to the French in carrying on
their fishery within the limits appointed
by treaty. These were also submitted to the
same law-officers for their opinion as to the
statute, and the power in the king to make
them. The law-officers made some alterations
in these instructions, and declared,
that in such form they might be legally
given to the governor, being conformable
with the thirteenth article of the treaty of
Utrecht, and not repugnant to the statute.
For, say they, although the statute seems
to confine the whole trade of Newfoundland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to English subjects; yet as the French
were at the time of passing the act, and had
been for many years before, in possession
of several parts of the island, and notoriously
carried on an open fishery, and
claimed to be entitled thereto; and as that
claim, and the exercise of a fishery there,
had not been rejected or disallowed by the
treaty of 1686, nor by the treaty of <i>Ryswick</i>
in 1697, although several petitions of merchants
and others had been presented to
the house of commons in the year 1696,
complaining of encroachments of the
French upon the English trade and fishery
there; it seemed to them, that the statute
was not meant to extend to such parts of
the island, and its adjacent isles and places,
as were then left in the possession of the
French; nor to abridge or restrain the power
of the crown over the same, consequential
upon the making of peace; the exercise
of which, in this instance, had received
the repeated approbation of both houses of
parliament in their resolutions upon the
treaties of <i>Utrecht</i> and <i>Paris</i><a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>The board of trade adopted the amendments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
made by the law-officers, and recommended
to his majesty the instructions so
altered to be given in charge to <i>Mr. Palliser</i>,
then governor of Newfoundland.
They took occasion, in their representation
at that time, to enlarge upon the nature
of that trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remarks of the
Board on Stat.
10 and 11 W. 3.</div>

<p>They said, that in framing these additional
instructions, it became necessary to
consider, with the closest attention, the
provisions and regulations of stat. 10 and 11
Will. 3.; which act, having been framed
and passed at a time when the crowns of Great
Britain and France had distinct rights and
possessions on that island, and the subjects
of both carried on distinct fisheries upon
those parts of the coasts, which belonged
to each respectively, was, they humbly
conceived, in no respect properly applicable
to the permissive fishery, which
the subjects of France were entitled by
treaty to carry on in common with the
English subjects within the limits described;
although, being an act in full force,
they had found themselves under the necessity,
in framing these additional instructions,
to conform to the regulations and
provisions of it, in many points, which did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in their opinion, render those instructions
less effectual and extensive than they might
otherwise have been.</p>

<p>But independent of this objection to the
act, they conceived it highly exceptionable
in almost every other light in which
it could be viewed. The regulations intended
for the fishery were in general by
no means applicable to the present state
of it, and such of them as might be of
use were not enforced by proper penalties.
And, considered as a regulation of government
and civil jurisdiction, this act, they
said, was the most loose and imperfect that
could have been framed, and necessity
had already introduced deviations from it
in many essential points.</p>

<p>Without entering into the particular regulations
of the act, and considering only
its principal imperfection, namely, the
fishery of the island being altogether
changed and varied from what it was, when
the act was passed, it appeared to them
to be disgraceful to suffer it to remain in
the statute-book. But as they feared it
was too late in that session to enter upon
any new parliamentary regulations, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
further consideration must be deferred for
the present, unless his majesty should be
of opinion that a repeal of the act should
be moved for, and a short law enacted,
impowering the king, by proclamation,
order in council, or instruction to the governor,
to make such regulations with respect
to this branch of commerce, as he
should, with the advice of his privy council,
judge most expedient<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>But nothing was done towards correcting
or repealing an act that had been condemned
so often by public and private
opinions of persons best able to judge of
its merits.</p>

<p>The attention of government was now
occupied by the questions which the late
treaty had brought forward. The French
court, more anxious than ever for the interests
of their fishery, had started a doubt
about the limits at Newfoundland, which
drew on a long discussion at the board of
trade. It had been intimated in the before-mentioned
project of arrangement,
and was afterwards pressed in a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
memorial from the French ambassador,
that <i>Point Riche</i>, mentioned in the treaty
of Utrecht, was the same as <i>Cape Ray</i>;
and that the French limits on that side
should, therefore, be extended as low as
<i>Cape Ray</i>. This piece of geography was,
on their part, founded on no better authority
than a map of <i>Herman Moll</i>; and
was shewn, by the board of trade in a
representation, drawn with great accuracy
and much at length, to be without any
foundation. In this report of the board,
it is demonstrated that all the French
geographers united with those of England
in assigning different places to <i>Point
Riche</i> and <i>Cape Ray</i>, and that the wording
of several public papers and documents,
made it beyond all doubt the clear
intention of both nations, that the French
limits should end at <i>Point Riche</i>, and
should not come down so low as <i>Cape Ray</i>,
confining the French to the limit called
<i>Petit Nord</i><a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the French at this
time gave great uneasiness. At the close
of this year, the board of trade made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
representation to his majesty, respecting
several ships of war being sent by the
French to <i>St. Pierre</i> and <i>Miquelon</i>, which
had been ceded to them by the peace;
these, it was supposed, were sent thither,
with a view to a sudden rupture, or at
least to give improper countenance and
hopes to the French in those parts; at
any rate such a measure was considered as
contrary to the treaty, by which those
places were ceded merely as a shelter to
the French fishermen<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. It was feared a
fishery was meant to be forced there out
of the French limits, and an illicit trade
carried on with the Indians. The ruinous
state of our forts and fortifications in
Newfoundland made these appearances
the more alarming. It was therefore, recommended
to put the forts upon a respectable
footing<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Representation
1765.</div>

<p>The board still kept in view the improvement
of the advantages obtained for
the fisheries in those parts, amongst which
that of Newfoundland was the chief; and
on the 29th of April 1765, they made a
second representation to his majesty, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
full than either of the former; and for
those who wish to be informed of the
nature of this trade, a very fit companion
to the representation made in the year 1718.
This was followed by a third, dated the
27th of March 1766, which also deserves
particular attention.</p>

<p>Among other improvements meditated
for Newfoundland, it was resolved to
establish custom-house officers. The
commissioners of the customs, in March
and May 1764, issued out deputations
constituting a collector and controller of
the customs at Newfoundland. We find
that <i>Captain Byng</i> had, in the year 1743,
appointed a naval officer as a necessary assistant
to him, in checking the illicit
trade there carried on. It does not appear
whether this appointment was continued
by his successors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Newfoundland
a plantation.</div>

<p>A seizure was made about this time at
Newfoundland of a ship, for want of a
register; it appeared to the commissioners
of the customs that Newfoundland had
hitherto been looked upon merely in the
light of <i>a fishery</i>, and vessels going thither
were not thought liable to the same regulations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
as those going to the other British
colonies and plantations: they now applied
to the treasury for advice on this
point<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; and the treasury referred it to the
board of trade for their opinion; who report,
that they saw no reason to doubt its
being a part of his majesty’s plantations,
and they thought its commerce, and the
ships bound thither, should be under the
same regulations as in the other plantations:
their lordships further thought,
that as the governor had suspected that
many foreigners were sharers in the fishery
and commerce of that island, and had
made seizure of three ships, in two of
which it clearly appeared that Spaniards
were concerned, it was highly expedient
and necessary, that the laws of navigation
should be carried into execution there<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Custom-house
established.</div>

<p>Thus by the establishment of a custom-house,
and the introduction of the laws of
navigation, was another pillar added to
the civil government of that place. But
this was considered and treated as an innovation
by those who clamoured for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
free fishery, and Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3.
and this institution being effected without
the authority of parliament, was questioned
in the same manner, and upon the
same ground, as the commissioners of the
peace, and of oyer and terminer. The
article of fees was a topic on which a
complaint might be founded with most
hopes of success, where the interests of
a fishery were concerned. This the
merchants pushed with petitions and
memorials for some time without prevailing:
and the fees of the custom-house
are a cause of complaint to this
very day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Property in
flakes, &amp;c. discussed.</div>

<p>The activity of <i>Mr. Palliser</i> during his
government, had contributed to bring
forward the old debated question of property
in flakes and stages. These questions
were of different sorts, the first related
to the parts between <i>Bonavista</i> and
<i>Point Riche</i>, the two limits of the French
fishery. Many tracts of land within those
limits were claimed as private property;
and, as such, might interfere with the concurrent
right of the French to fish there.
This matter was agitated at the board of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
trade, and an additional instruction upon
that head was given to the governor, by
which he was commanded, not upon any
pretence whatsoever, to allow any <i>exclusive
possession</i> to be taken, as private property,
of any lands, rivers, or islands in the northern
parts, between <i>Bonavista</i> and <i>Point
Riche</i>; taking special care that such ships
as resorted to that part, should chuse
their stations as they arrived, and should
take up, and occupy, subject to the
governor’s controul, such space only of
beach as was proportioned to the number
of their boats, conformable to Stat.
10 &amp; 11 Will. 3<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Justices appointed.</div>

<p>This provision was with a design of
preserving peace between the fishermen
of the two nations. But the exclusive
property which some persons claimed in
stages, flakes, and beach, was a question
that applied to the whole of the island;
and had become of a magnitude to call
for some discussion and adjustment. The
board of trade thought proper to consult
<i>Mr. Yorke</i>, then attorney general, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
this point. They proposed to him two
questions; first, Whether exclusive property
in any part of Newfoundland can
be acquired under colour of any provision
of Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3, without a
grant or patent from the crown? secondly,
If any part of that act does warrant such
exclusive property, what is the nature and
extent of it? Can it be acquired for the
purposes of cultivation, and settlement of
the land, or is it confined to the purposes
of fishing; and in what manner, and
upon what principles, and by whom are
any disputes arising thereupon to be decided?</p>

<p>By the answer to these queries, it was
hoped to obtain some clear judgment
upon these points, for the direction of
the governors; who had sometimes considered
this as real, sometimes as personal
property, at other times as no property
at all; and were involved in
great difficulties, and exposed to vexatious
suits for what they had done
at Newfoundland, in relation to this
doubtful sort of occupation and possession.
But I do not find that these questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
were resolved by the attorney-general,
or that the board pressed him for
any answer to them<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. So that these
points remained for examination in after-times.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Palliser</i> carried into execution upon
the coast of <i>Labrador</i> (which by proclamation,
the 7th of October 1763, had
been separated from <i>Canada</i>, and annexed
to the government of Newfoundland)
that plan of a free fishery, to be carried
on by ships from Great Britain, which
was practised at Newfoundland, and
which he had shewn himself so determined
to maintain upon its original principles.
In order to accomplish this he had contest
with exclusive property. Several persons
claimed on that coast a property in fishing-posts
and settlements; some under grants
from the French governors of <i>Canada</i>; some
from <i>General Murray</i>. These he broke in
upon, and withal he treated the American
subjects of Great Britain, who were concerned
in some of these settlements, as
excluded from this fishery, by Stat. 10 &amp;
11 Will. 3. which statute he held to apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to <i>Labrador</i>, now it was brought within
the government of Newfoundland, and
under the authority thereof he contested
the private rights set up on that coast.
To give effect to these principles, he made
some <i>rules and regulations</i> for carrying on
the fishery in those parts.</p>

<p>These novelties caused many complaints
to be brought before the board of trade,
which led to very long enquiry for three
or four years, at different times.</p>

<p>Upon these questions, the board of
trade took some measures; with regard
to the Americans, they were of opinion
that it was not the design of the Stat. 10
&amp; 11 Will. 3. to exclude from the fishery
ships fitted out from America. With regard
to the other points which turned
upon considerations of property and legal
topics, they referred to the attorney and
solicitor general, some cases of grants
from French governors. Upon view of
these cases, the law officers were of opinion,
that these could not be allowed as
valid in any judicial enquiry, and ought
not to stand in the way of any rules, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
regulations to be made in the government
of that coast<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<p>Some time after, it appeared to the
board, that the forcing of these rules
and regulations, in order to throw open
the fishery there to adventurers from Great
Britain, was not a wise policy. They were
calculated only for a cod, or whale fishery,
whereas the seal fishery, which was most
pursued here, was a <i>sedentary fishery</i>, and
needed the encouragement of exclusive
property, to support the expence of the
adventure. They therefore, on the 24th
of June 1772, recommended to his majesty
that the coast of <i>Labradore</i> should
be re-annexed to the government of <i>Quebec</i><a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.
This would certainly put an end
to the disquietude under which persons
laboured, who had private property there,
which they saw exposed to the operation
of Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Will. 3. This, however,
does not seem to have been the
reason for the board recommending such
measure; for being called upon to reconsider
their opinion as to the re-annexing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the coast of <i>Labradore</i> to the government
of <i>Quebec</i>; they said, that it was
not in consideration of the loss which individuals
would sustain, if private property
was disturbed, but they said, when
it appeared to them that a great part of
that coast was claimed as private property,
under grants from the governors of <i>Canada</i>;
and that his majesty was bound by
treaty to admit those claims; they thought
he could not in justice enforce regulations
that were subversive of those rights<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.
According to the principle here laid down,
the <i>Quebec act</i> Stat. 14, Geo. 3, c. 83, annexed
to that government all such territories,
islands, and countries as had, since
the 10th February 1763, been part of the
government of Newfoundland, and they
were so to continue during his majesty’s
pleasure<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stat. 15, Geo.
3.</div>

<p>The last measure taken respecting Newfoundland,
during this period, was passing
Stat. 15, Geo. 3, c. 31, commonly
called in the island, <i>Sir Hugh Palliser’s
act</i>; it being supposed to have originated
from the advice and assistance, principally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of that gentleman. The design
of this act was to favour, and keep
alive, the principle of a ship-fishery carried
on from England: one of the regulations
of it, was to enforce the payment
of wages, another to secure the
return of seamen, and fisherman to this
country; the provisions of it are all enforced
by a special penalty, the want of
which in Stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. had
been so often lamented.</p>

<p>The nature of the provisions of this
act, and the rigour with which it was
easy to enforce them, contributed to make
this law very unpopular in the island;
and after all the alterations that had been
made, without the aid of parliament, since
Stat. 10 &amp; II Will. 3. none was so ill received
as this; but, being an act of the
legislature, it was submitted to with silent
discontent. When persons concerned in
this trade complain of the innovations
made of late years in the trade of Newfoundland,
and express a wish to be
put on the footing of Stat. 10 and 11
Will. 3, they mean, that they wish
to be relieved from this act of parliament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and they have, many of them,
no scruple to say, that since <i>Sir Hugh
Palliser’s act</i>, it is with the greatest
difficulty that merchants can carry on
the fishery with profit to themselves.</p>

<p>The regulations made by this act were
very important. It was now declared,
that the privilege of drying fish on the
shores of Newfoundland, should be enjoyed
only by his majesty’s subjects arriving
at Newfoundland from Great Britain, or
one of the British dominions in Europe;
which settled the question that had
been raised in favour of the colonists.
This act gave several bounties for encouraging
industry in the take of fish.
It provided for securing the return of
the seamen to Europe; by empowering
the master to detain, out of their wages,
forty shillings for paying their passage
home; and obliging him to see his men
put on board passage-vessels. It forbad
masters to suffer seamen to take up more
than half their wages in articles of supply;
and obliged them to pay the other half in
cash, or good bills on England or Ireland.
It gave to the seamen a lien on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the fish, and oil for their wages; and, to
secure the execution of this act, penalties
were annexed to the various provisions,
and a jurisdiction given to the court
of session, and vice-admiralty to enforce
those penalties.</p>

<p>During the last five or six years that
the board of trade continued in existence,
there appears nothing of importance
upon the books respecting this trade
and fishery. That board was abolished in
1782. It was not till June 1784, that a
committee of council was appointed by
his majesty for matters of trade and plantations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Import of live
Stock, &amp;c.</div>

<p>In this interval, the war had determined,
and the independence of the United
States of America had produced, a new
position of affairs in that part of the world,
by which Newfoundland was affected, as
well as the other parts of his majesty’s
territories in America. One of the first
questions that was occasioned by this revolution
was, the supply of provisions for
Newfoundland and the fishery. These had
before the war, come in a great measure
from the Colonies that were now separated;
and before the new situation of things
was quite understood, this supply, it was
thought, might still be occasionally permitted,
and, in a case of distress, had actually
been resorted to. The western merchants
took alarm at the appearance of an intercourse
being allowed between the United
States and their fishery; they presented
memorials to have a stop put to it; they
alledged the place might be supplied from
<i>Great Britain</i> or <i>Canada</i>. The allegations
on both sides, of those who argued for a
supply, under certain limitations, from the
United States, and of those who were
wholly against this intercourse, led to long
examination of witnesses, and various considerations
of policy, before the lords of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the committee<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. This ended in the committee
resolving, in January 1785, to recommend
to his majesty, that a permission
should be given to import bread, flour,
and live stock, in British bottoms, which
ships should clear out from the king’s dominions
in Europe, with a licence from the
commissioners of the customs, which should
be in force for seven months. As this licence
was to be for seven months, and the
temporary act for regulating the intercourse
with the United States would expire
in less time, it was suggested by the attorney
and solicitor general, whether it
might not be better to pass a special act
for this purpose<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. The committee accordingly
recommended to his majesty,
that a bill to that effect should be proposed
in parliament, but that it should be in force
for that season only<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. Such an act was
accordingly passed; namely, stat. 26 Geo.
3. C.I. The same question was revived the
following year; when it was considered
whether the act should be renewed. Examinations
in like manner were had; in
which the merchants declared, they were
of the same opinion as they had been last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
year; but that they had rather the bill of
last year should be renewed, than the trade
between Newfoundland and the United
States should be laid intirely open<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. The
committee came to the resolution, that the
act should be renewed<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Representation
on a Bill
brought in by
the Western
Merchants.</div>

<p>In the mean time, the encouragement of
the fishery had come under the consideration
of the committee—A bill had been
brought into the house of commons at the
instance of the western merchants; in
this bill it was intended to make several
alterations in the law of Newfoundland;
the principal points of which were, to
give the present possessors a permanent interest
in their lands, and to repeal some
material regulations of stat. 15 Geo. 3.
which the merchants had always disliked.</p>

<p>On 9th December 1785, his majesty was
pleased to refer the matter of this bill to
the committee for them to consider it, and
to report their opinion thereon. This bill
was read at the board on the 14th of
January 1786, and every provision of it
was separately discussed. The subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the fishery was under consideration for
several weeks<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. At length the committee
made a report on the intended bill. This
report contains their opinion upon most of
the points relating to Newfoundland, and
is therefore well deserving of notice. It
has been laid before the house of commons,
and is now in print. The report was unfavourable
to the bill, which was accordingly
laid aside<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. However, another was
introduced, and passed into a law, and is
stat. 26 Geo. 3. c. 26. This act continued
the bounties given by stat. 15 Geo. 3.
and contributed to render more complete
the plan begun by that statute, for preventing
the seamen and fishermen withdrawing
themselves from this country,
either by staying at Newfoundland, or
deserting to other places.</p>

<p>In the year 1788, the intercourse between
the United States and Newfoundland was
again agitated; and upon the strong representations
of the <i>Quebec</i> merchants, the committee
were of opinion for proposing a bill
to parliament, to prevent entirely the supply
of bread, flour, and live stock, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
United States; but, at the instance of the
western merchants, this intention was
dropt<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. The following year the mode of
occasional supply was continued, at the
desire of the western merchants, and so it
has gone on ever since by authority of
stat. 28 Geo. 3. c. 6. s. 13.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two acts passed.</div>

<p>In this and the following sessions two acts
of parliament were passed respecting Newfoundland.
By stat. 28 Geo. 3. c. 35. his
majesty was enabled to make some regulations
at Newfoundland, to prevent inconveniencies
that might arise from the competition
of the English and the French in
the fishery. By stat. 29 Geo. 3. c. 53. it is
declared, that fish, not caught by subjects
of Great Britain going from the British
dominions in Europe, may not be landed
or dried at Newfoundland. This last act
was occasioned by the people of <i>Bermuda</i>
having engaged in the fishery, and selling
their fish to those who had a clear right to
dry and cure on the island; by this provision
the design of stat. 15 Geo. 3. c. 31. in
confining the fishery to ships going from
Europe, was fully secured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Complaints
about courts.</div>

<p>A new subject of complaint had grown
up in Newfoundland—this was the hearing
and determining of <i>civil causes</i>. Among all
the grievances, and the expedients for remedying
them, during the tract of time
we have gone through, there seems to
have been no solicitude or attempt to
provide <i>a court of civil jurisdiction</i>. While
this place continued merely a fishery, the
causes of action between parties were simple
and of less magnitude; but of late years
the population had encreased, and among
the persons resident there were dealings of
a mercantile nature to a great extent, and
of a sort to need a judicature, that would
command more confidence than any of the
old establishments had been thought entitled
to. There arose therefore, from
time to time, discontents upon this head,
and these led to measures that ended in
making an intire new establishment of a
court. To make this subject more intelligible,
we should look back to the courts that
had hitherto been known at Newfoundland,
the nature and jurisdiction of which
were brought under consideration at this
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Review of the
Courts of Newfoundland.</div>

<p>The first regulation that looked at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
like a court, was the authority given by
stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. c. 25. s. 15. to the
fishing admirals, to hear and determine
controversies and differences between the
masters of fishing ships, and the inhabitants,
or any bye boat-keeper, concerning
the right and property of fishing rooms,
stages, flakes, or any other buildings or
conveniency for fishing or curing fish; and
if either party thought himself aggrieved,
he might appeal to the commander of any
of the king’s ships belonging to the convoy.
This was a civil judicature of a limited
sort—the <i>adventurers</i> or <i>merchants</i>, it should
seem, were not liable to it; it was confined
also in its object; <i>debts</i> still remained without
any mode of recovery, as well as all
other personal wrongs of a civil nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fishing Admirals</div>

<p>Another jurisdiction was given to the
fishing admirals by this act: by sect. 14 they
were to see the rules and orders contained
in that act concerning the regulation of
the fishery duly put in execution; and this
was given them, as the act expresses it,
<i>to preserve peace and good government among
the</i> <span class="smcap">SEAMEN</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">FISHERMEN</span>, <i>as well in
their respective harbours, as on the shore</i>. This
was a sort of police invested in them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
which might be considered as partaking
both of a civil and criminal authority.
But this also, like the former, was limited
as to the persons; no authority was given
that could be exercised over the merchants
and adventurers, who seem to be considered
by this act as persons who might
have right done them; but against whom it
was not necessary to do any justice whatsoever—for,
by the rules and orders of this
act, the fishing admirals would be obliged
to see they had ships-room; and their seamen
and fishermen would be kept quiet
and under controul; but if these adventurers
had taken possession of any <i>fishing
rooms, stages, flakes, or other conveniency for
the fishery</i>, the admirals had no jurisdiction
to call them to account, and to make restitution
to the right owner, their jurisdiction
in that particular being confined to
the <i>masters of fishing ships, inhabitants, and
bye boat-keepers</i>.</p>

<p>The merchants and adventurers being
therefore subjected by this act to no controul
or authority whatsoever, when they
begun to settle, and to have mercantile
dealings, to a great amount, they had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to do but to take the law into their
own hands; and having possessed themselves
of plantations or fish, or any thing
else, in payment of debts, real or pretended,
there subsisted, under this act, no
power whatsoever to call them to account;
and it was, no doubt, for this reason, that
the merchants have so constantly adhered
to the support of this act, declaring that a
free fishery, conducted under the policy of
this act, was all they wanted, and complaining
that every regulation made since
that act has invariably operated to injure
the trade and fishery. It was indeed
the policy of this country to support a free
fishery there, for ships going from hence,
and to prevent settlement. So far the
views of the government and the interest
of the merchants concurred; but the application
of this principle had the effect of
leaving the island to the mercy of the adventurers,
who found it their interest at
length even to promote <i>settlement</i> to a
certain degree; contrary to their own declarations,
and to the policy of stat. 10 &amp;
11 Will. 3.; for no part of which they
seem to have had any value, but the feeble
judicature and police it gave the island;
in consequence of which, they saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
whole fishery abandoned to their sole will
and pleasure.</p>

<p>These observations upon the incomplete
form of this judicature and police,
suggest themselves upon the bare reading
of the act; but the experience of the manner
in which it was executed, shewed all
this in a more aggravated appearance. It
has been too often repeated in the course
of this historical enquiry to need repetition
here, that the admirals were the servants
of the merchants, inasmuch as they were the
masters of some of their ships; that in many
cases, therefore, justice was not to be expected
from them; that is, in cases where
their owners were concerned. In many
others, where their owners or themselves
were not concerned, there was always a
partiality towards the description and class
of persons with which they were connected;
and a poor planter, or inhabitant,
(who was considered as little better than a
law-breaker in being such) had but small
chance of justice, in opposition to any
great west-country merchant. This bias
must have been a strong impediment to the
equal administration of justice in the hands
of the fishing admirals. Besides this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
which arose from their employment and
connection, there was another disqualification,
that was to be corrected by no integrity
or fairness whatsoever. It should seem,
that persons, educated as masters of merchant
ships, could not in general possess that
discrimination and discernment, which was
necessary for determining right and property,
even in fishing stages and flakes.</p>

<p>Such being the judicature established by
the statute of King William, and such the
hands in which it was lodged, we have
found, that it was executed fully as ill as
could from the nature of it be expected.
We find that the admirals were most of
their time out on the fishery; that, when
in harbour, they were still employed about
curing of their fish, and the other parts of
their business; that the commanders of the
king’s ships were obliged to summon, enjoin,
and enforce them to hold courts;
that discovering the sluggishness of the
admirals, they were under the necessity of
taking liberties not given by the statute;
that, being only a court of appeal, they were
obliged to erect themselves into an original
court. This they did by degrees, and
with a sort of deference to the provisions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the act of parliament. At first they got
the admirals to sit with them; and I have
seen many judgments and proceedings to
which the commander of some of the king’s
ships has first subscribed his name, and the
admirals have added theirs. It is not to be
wondered, that the commanders of the
king’s ships, with their superior endowments,
should gradually obtain an ascendancy;
and having thus blended their
appellate jurisdiction with the original one
lodged in the admirals, should at length
wholly dispense with their attendance of
the fishing admirals (who would be glad
enough to be excused), and so in time succeed
to a complete original exercise of judicial
authority in the place of the admirals.</p>

<p>So indeed it happened. But there were
not wanting occasions, when the admirals
awaked from their lethargy, and shewed a
steadiness in asserting the dormant powers
lodged in them by the statute. These
were when the adventurers and merchants
perceived the government at home were
making any attempt to introduce a better
system of law and order into Newfoundland.
Accordingly, we have seen, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
upon the appointment of a civil governor
and justices, in the year 1729, the admirals
bestirred themselves; and, from the impulse
which the competition inspired for
the moment, they actually took upon them
all the authority they possessed under the
statute. They even went further, and
claimed a criminal as well as a civil judicature;
and proceeded to issue warrants,
and do acts which belong to justices of the
peace. In these usurpations they were
supported by the western merchants, whose
language it was to represent the provisions
of stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3 as competent to
the complete government of the island in
all matters, both civil and criminal.</p>

<p>But with all this support, so limited a
power, lodged in such feeble hands, could
not sustain the contest; and the admirals
soon fell back into the inactivity, neglect,
and contempt, where they had before
slumbered. As they sunk, the commanders
of the king’s ships rose into importance;
the statute of William grew to be
looked upon as a dead letter; and the administration
of justice, in all the points
there conferred on the admirals, was expected
from nobody but the commanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of the king’s ships, when they came to the
island in the summer season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrogates.</div>

<p>Although the hearing of certain matters,
by way of <i>appeal</i>, was given to the commanders
by the statute, yet the hearing of
them <i>originally</i> was not authorized. The
possession of the former gave a colour for
assuming the latter; and crude as this
may seem, it was, perhaps, as well warranted
as some of the instances of jurisdiction
now exercised, and from long
usage allowed to the first courts in Westminster-hall.
When the captains were in
possession of this, they proceeded, as happens
mostly in the exercise of power and
authority; they found in that place, as it
is elsewhere, that all judges have the
quality which is invariably supposed to
belong to the best, that of enlarging the
sphere of their cognizance<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>: and we find
very soon, that the captains of ships took
cognizance of <i>debts</i> contracted; and held
courts, in which they enquired of, heard,
and determined all possible causes of complaints;
and with no other lights than
those furnished by the statute of <i>William</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the instructions from the governor, and
the suggestions of their own good sense;
paying always a due regard to the customs
and usages of the country. They did
every thing, that the fishing admirals
might do, and every thing the admirals
had at different times pretended to have
a right to do. From their situation, and
the support they received from the governor,
they were enabled to maintain the
jurisdiction they had assumed. The governor
conferred on them the title of
<i>surrogates</i>, an idea taken from the admiralty-law;
to which, and which alone the
naval governors were in the habit of looking,
and under which it had long been a notion,
that the fishery, as an admiralty concern,
ought to be regulated. A <i>surrogate</i>
is well known in Newfoundland,
as legally deputed by the governor, to
act as his deputy. Under this character
the authority of the governor was exercised
very beneficially. The time of
<i>surrogating</i> was looked forward to as a
season when all wrongs were to be redressed
against all oppressors; and this
naval judicature was flown to by the poor
inhabitants and planters, as the only refuge
they had from the west country merchants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
who were always their creditors,
and were generally regarded as their oppressors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The governor
holds a court.</div>

<p>While the <i>surrogates</i> in the different
parts of the island were administering justice
in this manner, the <i>governor</i> had also
his court at <i>St. John’s</i>; and, it is easy to
believe, that every thing which the surrogates
permitted to themselves, the governor
thought himself equally entitled
to do and command. Every matter, civil,
and criminal, used to be heard, and determined
in open court before the governor.
Where no special direction was pointed
out by law, a person in that situation
was to be commended for striking out
such a course as the exigency of the situation,
and the good of the place required.
This desire of doing good sometimes carried
the governors further than strict legal
propriety could warrant. They used to
preside in the sessions of justices, although
it was from their authority that
the commission of the justices issued. It
would be endless and unnecessary to
enter into the instances of irregularity
that must follow, when judicatures
were instituted in such a place as this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
by persons who had nothing for their
guide but the rectitude of their intentions,
and a very honourable disposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Courts of vice-admiralty
and
session.</div>

<p>In the year 1765, a custom-house being
established at <i>St. John’s</i>, a court of vice-admiralty,
(the court of revenue in the
plantations) was placed there. This court,
in the absence of the governor, during
the winter, had entertained complaints in
other matters than those peculiarly belonging
to it. In this it only followed
the example of the <i>court of sessions</i>, where
the justices had allowed the hearing of
matters of <i>debt</i>, and other subjects of difference
of a civil nature. It was in consequence
of this usage, that the parliament
afterwards conferred on the court of
vice-admiralty, and the session, a jurisdiction
of a civil nature. By Stat. 15,
Geo. 3, c. 32. they have authority to determine
disputes concerning the wages of
seamen and fishermen, and the offences
committed by their hirers and employers
against that act. This jurisdiction was
taken from the court of vice-admiralty,
by Stat. 26, Geo. 3, c. 26, owing to
the unfavourable impressions that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
been made respecting the practice which
had prevailed in that court.</p>

<p>Although the parliament took away
from the vice-admiralty court the authority
vested in it by law, it still continued
to exercise that which no law had
conferred on it; and both that court and
the sessions were resorted to in the absence
of the governor and surrogates, for
the administration of justice in all civil
cases whatsoever. Justice administered
under such circumstances could have but
little of the authority and effect, which
should attend upon the sentence of a
court. There was no doubt in the minds
of any, above the very lowest class, but
the whole of this judicature was an usurpation:
it was, therefore, more frequently
employed as an engine of authority, to
obtain that by a course of law, which could
not, perhaps, be attained by open violence,
than as the means of protecting the
weak against the powerful. A merchant
rather chose to have the assistance of the
court of session or admiralty, to attach and
seize the effects of his debtor, than incur
the odium of taking them with force.
The appearance of a legal course was preferable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
But should a wealthy merchant
become defendant in one of these courts,
it was not so sure that he would approve
the same legal course, or yield the same
obedience to a sentence. He, as well as
the court knew, there was no legal authority
to compel; and it was a question
of prudence only, whether such a defendant
would submit quietly to their order.
If the court happened to have in it
persons who acted with vigour, and had
character and influence sufficient to cause
its decrees to be duely executed; it would,
in such case, be but a bad prospect for a
merchant to look for redress by an action,
to be brought in England against a man
who, perhaps, never might make a visit
there. Such considerations might operate
with the merchants to obey these courts,
even when they decided against them.
Besides, a merchant might think it for his
advantage to yield, in one instance, to a
court, which in so many others he found
useful; he being more frequently plaintiff
than defendant.</p>

<p>It was in this manner, by a sort of
convention, upon views partly private,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
partly public, with a design sometimes
selfish, often generally beneficial, but
never without the concurrence and support
of the majority of those most interested,
was a judicature gradually conferred
on these two courts, which with the
governor, and the surrogates, possessed
all the judicature in the island, civil as well
as criminal.</p>

<p>But a time was coming, when a judicature,
that stood on so weak a foundation,
was to be shaken. Though the justices,
and the judge of the admiralty
court might never come to England, the
governor and his surrogates necessarily
did. In the time of <i>governor Edwards</i>,
some persons, discontented with a judgement
made by him in court, at <i>St. John’s</i>,
and carried into execution by the sheriff
there, meant to redress themselves by
bringing an action against the governor
for a trespass in so depriving them of their
property. This was to have been tried at
<i>Exeter</i>, but it was made up before the case
was gone through to the jury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The governors
cease to hold
courts.</div>

<p>The governor got well quit of this
business, and he proceeded, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
remainder of his time, to hear causes
in person, without the least doubt or
difficulty, as his predecessors had before
done. But the minds of men were
changed upon this subject; and his successor
<i>Admiral Campbell</i>, 1782, was advised
not to take upon him to sit in court,
as his predecessors had done, nor to determine
any causes whatsoever. He substituted
in the room of this, a mode which
was certainly without exception; and
which, in a country like that, could not
fail of having a very useful, and very extensive
effect. The petitions which used
to be brought to the governor in great
numbers, upon all sorts of questions and
subjects, were still received as before; but
instead of holding a court, and making
decisions, which were to be enforced by
the sheriff, he directed his secretary to
hear the complainant, and if necessary,
the party, against whom the complaint
was made, and thereupon to write at the
bottom of the petition the governor’s opinion,
and give such <i>advice</i>, as if followed,
would have the effect of complete justice.
Advice and direction given from
such authority was most usually followed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and the administration of justice was,
in a great degree, attained in this mode
of application, without any course of process,
as in a regular and open court.</p>

<p>However, in many cases, this method
was not acceptable; and many more persons
began, after this time, to recur to
the courts of session, and vice-admiralty;
and these two courts, as they were open
all the winter, presented a more useful,
and certain course of redress, than the
above mode of petition. These two courts
encreased very much in business from the
beginning of <i>Admiral Campbell’s</i> government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Court of common
pleas instituted.</div>

<p>But these two courts derived this accession
of business from the necessity of circumstances
merely; their authority was
still as feeble as before, and the exercise of
it depended upon the like precarious circumstances,
for being carried into effect.
As the population of St. John’s encreased,
and as the light of later times, which
spreads every where, had reached that
place, it became necessary to have something
more than opinion and sufferance
to found a judicial authority upon. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
<i>Admiral Milbanke</i> was to set out to his government,
in the summer of 1789, he was
strongly advised by his secretary, Mr.
Graham, (who had been secretary to the
three preceding governors) to get something
of a court established, that might
stand on unquestionable authority; and
the governor’s commission being searched
for this purpose, it was found that he had
full power to appoint <i>judges, and in cases
necessary, justices of oyer and terminer, &amp;c.</i>
It was suggested to him, that <i>judges</i>, contrasted
as the word there seemed to be with
<i>justices of oyer and terminer</i>, ought to be
considered as meaning something different
from such justices; and that being in a
popular, untechnical sense, usually applied
to those who preside in the three
courts in Westminster-hall, it had grown
in the minds of unprofessional men to
signify more especially judges in <i>civil</i>
matters; that it therefore seemed, the governor,
by these words, had authority to
institute a court of <i>civil</i> jurisdiction; and
he was accordingly advised to institute a
court of <i>common pleas</i> to proceed by a jury
in the manner of a court of common law
in this kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Justices appointed.</div>

<p>This opinion upon the wording of the
commission, was urged not to be a strained
exposition, to obtain <i>totidem verbis</i>, an
authority which perhaps might not have
been intended to be given; but to be a
necessary one, and such alone, as could
be drawn from the words. But those
who have read the foregoing history, of the
first granting to the governor the authority
of appointing commissioners of oyer and
terminer, will be satisfied, when he reads the
same words in the first commission granted
for that purpose, that they were designed
to convey nothing more than that
simple authority. One may be a little
surprised how a power of appointing commissioners
of oyer and terminer should
be penned so as to stand <i>judges, and in
cases necessary justices of oyer and terminer</i>.
But it appears that in commissions to West
India, and other governors, where it was
meant to convey the power of appointing
standing <i>judges</i>, as well as occasional <i>justices</i>,
these words are to be found, placed
in this manner; and in the way precedents
are followed, these words were copied,
where it was meant to appoint only justices
of oyer and terminer, and those occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Complaints
against it.</div>

<p>The governor’s authority, whatever it
might be, was actually carried into effect,
by an appointment of a court of common
pleas, and judges, in the summer 1789.
This court of common pleas transacted
business during the following winter; but
the western merchants preferred very heavy
complaints against the proceedings of this
court; what they alledge against it may
be seen shortly stated in the representation
afterwards made by the committee of
trade, and now printed by order of the
House of Commons. Their great objection,
which they do <i>not</i> state, but which I
will venture to do for them is this; that
they now saw a court established (as they
believed) upon good authority, with
which they could not trifle, as they had
been used to do with the feeble judicatures
before-mentioned; those inefficient
courts they preferred, because they could
make use of them when they needed their
assistance, and could intimidate the justices,
and obstruct their proceedings,
whenever they themselves were to be the
objects of animadversion. They had been
in the habit of seeing this species of weakness
and anarchy ever since Newfoundland
was frequented, from father to son;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it was favourable to their old impressions,
that Newfoundland was <i>theirs</i>, and that
all the planters and inhabitants were to
be spoiled and devoured at <i>their</i> pleasure;
in support of this, they had opposed,
as we have seen, every attempt
at introducing order and government into
that place. It was in this spirit, that
they questioned the king’s right to appoint
a civil governor, to appoint justices
of the peace, to appoint commissioners of
oyer and terminer; that they complained
of the custom-house, and even talked of
presenting it as a nuisance, because erected
on ship’s room; that they treated
Stat. 15, Geo. 3, as destructive to the
fishery, because it compels the payment
of servants’ wages; and that they brought
forward a bill in 1785, in order to expose
the servants once more to the will of their
masters, as to the payment of their wages.</p>

<p>These clamours were backed with the
popular representation, that the fishery
should be <i>free</i>, and that a fishery carried on
from this country, as the western merchants
carried it on, was the old and true
policy for Newfoundland. But their
claims to a free fishery seem to be these;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
namely, to be free of all inspection from
government; no justices, no courts, no custom-house.
This is what they mean, when
they wish all <i>restraints</i> to be taken off the
fishery, so as they may carry it on upon
the footing of Stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Representation.</div>

<p>The pretences urged by the merchants
against the court were seen through by his
majesty’s servants; but it appearing to the
law-officers, that the governor had not
authority under the words of his commission
before observed upon, to institute
that, or any other court, for civil causes;
and it appearing to the committee of council
for trade, that <i>a court of civil jurisdiction</i>
ought to be established there, they recommended
to his majesty to appoint or to
authorise the governor, by proper words,
to appoint one; and this court, they recommended,
should proceed in a summary
way. The opinion of the board on this
matter will be better seen in the <i>representation</i>
they made to his majesty, which was
laid before the house of commons, and
has been printed by their order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Act passed
for a Court of
Civil Judication.</div>

<p>However, no court was then established;
and the court of common pleas, instituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
by the governor, continued, during the
year 1790, to proceed as before. The subject
was taken up by the committee of trade
in the year 1791; and a bill was presented
to parliament, under their direction, for
instituting a court of the sort they had recommended
in the representation made in
1790. This bill passed into a law; and
being intended as an experiment of a
new judicature, it was to endure for one
year only. The result of that experiment
was to propose another bill in the sessions
of 1792, for instituting a court somewhat
different from that of the preceding bill.
This also was only for a year.</p>

<p>It is now for the consideration of parliament
finally to determine what courts are
to be established in the island for the administration
of justice in future.</p>

<p>Whereas the fisheries carried
on by his Majesty’s subjects of
<i>Great Britain</i>, and of the <i>British</i> dominions
in <i>Europe</i> have been found to be the
best nurseries for able and experienced
seamen, always ready to man the royal
navy when occasions require; and it is
therefore of the highest national importance
to give all due encouragement to the
said fisheries, and to endeavour to secure
the annual return of the fishermen, sailors,
and others employed therein, to the ports
of <i>Great Britain</i>, and of his Majesty’s dominions
before-mentioned, at the end of
every fishing season: Now, in order to promote
these great and important purposes,
and with a view, in the first place,
to induce his Majesty’s subjects to proceed
early from the ports of <i>Great Britain</i>
to the banks of <i>Newfoundland</i>, and thereby
to prosecute the fishery on the said banks
to the greatest advantage, may it please
Your Majesty that it may be enacted;
and be it enacted by the King’s most excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>

provision has been made to prevent
seamen and mariners in the merchant service
being wilfully left beyond sea, and to
secure and provide for their return home
to such part of his Majesty’s dominions
whereto they belong: and whereas, for
want of such provisions being extended to
seamen and fishermen going out as passengers
to <i>Newfoundland</i>, and hired and
employed in the fisheries carried on there,
great numbers of them remain in that
country at the end of every fishing season,
who would otherwise return home, and
some of them have frequently turned robbers
and pirates; for remedy of which evil,
be it enacted by the authority aforesaid,
That no person or persons whatsoever shall,
from and after the first day of <i>January</i> one

said privilege or exemption so given by the
said act to mariners serving on board ships

on shore there, is prejudicial to the
fisheries carried on by his Majesty’s subjects

fifteenth year of the reign of his present
Majesty, intituled, <i>An act for the encouragement

return of the fishermen, sailors, and others
employed in the said fisheries, to the ports

will expire on the first day of <i>January</i>
one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven:
And whereas, at the expiration
thereof, it is expedient that new bounties
should be granted, for a limited time, under
certain conditions, limitations, and restrictions:
And whereas it has been found
by experience, that several of the provisions
and regulations contained in the laws
now in force for encouraging the fisheries,
carried on at <i>Newfoundland</i>, and parts adjacent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span>
are insufficient to answer the good
purposes thereby intended, and that it is
requisite that other provisions and regulations
should be enacted: To that end, be
it therefore enacted by the King’s most excellent
Majesty, by and with the advice and
consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of
the same, That, from and after the first
day of <i>January</i> one thousand seven hundred
and eighty-seven, the respective bounties
herein-after mentioned shall be paid
and allowed annually, for ten years, to a
certain number of ships or vessels employed
in the <i>British</i> fishery on the banks of
<i>Newfoundland</i>, under the limitations and
restrictions herein-after expressed; that is
to say, That such vessels shall appear by
their register to be <i>British</i>-built, and
wholly owned by his Majesty’s subjects residing
in <i>Great Britain</i>, <i>Ireland</i>, or the
islands of <i>Guernsey</i>, <i>Jersey</i>, or <i>Man</i>; and
shall be navigated each with a master, and
at least three fourths of the mariners being
<i>British</i> subjects, usually residing in his
Majesty’s <i>European</i> dominions; and shall
be in other respects qualified and subject to
the same rules and restrictions as are prescribed
by an act, made in the tenth and
eleventh years of the reign of King <i>William</i>
the third, intituled, <i>An act to encourage
the trade to <span class="antiqua">Newfoundland</span></i>; and shall
be fitted and cleared out from some port in

<i>Jersey</i>, or <i>Alderney</i>, after the said first
day of <i>January</i> one thousand seven hundred
and eighty-seven, and after that day
in each succeeding year, and shall proceed
to the banks of <i>Newfoundland</i>; and having
catched a cargo of fish upon those
banks, consisting of not less than ten
thousand fish by tale, shall land the same
at any one of the ports on the north, the
east, or the south side of the island of
<i>Newfoundland</i>, between <i>Cape Saint John</i>
and <i>Cape Raye</i>, on or before the fifteenth
day of <i>July</i> in each year, and shall make
one more trip, at least, to the said banks,
and return with another cargo of fish
catched there, to the same port: In which
case, the one hundred vessels which shall
first arrive at the island of <i>Newfoundland</i>,
from the banks thereof, with a cargo of
fish catched there, consisting of ten thousand
fish by tale, at the least, and which,
after landing the same at one of the ports
within the limits before-mentioned in
<i>Newfoundland</i>, shall proceed again to the
said banks, and return to the said island
with another cargo of fish, shall, if navigated
with not less than twelve men each,
be intitled to forty pounds each; but if
any of the said one hundred vessels, so first
arriving as aforesaid, shall be navigated
with less than twelve men each, and not less
than seven, they shall be intitled to twenty-five
pounds each: Provided always, That
if, in either of the cases before-mentioned,
any of the one hundred vessels, so first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span>
arriving as aforesaid, shall be wholly navigated
by men going out upon shares, that
is to say, receiving a certain share of the
profits arising from the voyage in lieu of
wages, such of the said vessels as shall be
so navigated by not less than twelve men
each, shall be intitled to fifty pounds each;
and if so navigated with a less number
than twelve men, and not less than seven, shall
be intitled to thirty-five pounds each. And
further, that the one hundred vessels which
shall next so arrive in order of time, on or
before the said fifteenth day of <i>July</i> in each
year, at the said island, with a like cargo,
and shall proceed again to the said banks,
and return from thence in the manner herein-before
mentioned, shall, if navigated
with not less than twelve men each, be
intitled to twenty-five pounds each; but if
such one hundred vessels, so arriving as
aforesaid the next in order of time, shall
be navigated each with less than twelve,
and not less than seven men, they shall be
intitled to eighteen pounds each: Provided
also, That if, in either of the cases last
mentioned, any of the vessels so arriving
next in order of time as aforesaid, shall be
so navigated wholly by men going out upon
shares, that is to say, receiving a certain
share of the profits arising from the voyage
in lieu of wages, such of the said vessels,
as shall be so navigated by not less than
twelve men each, shall be intitled to thirty-five
pounds each; and if so navigated

twenty-one pounds each; upon the master

vessel was cleared out, or if cleared out

some port of <i>Great Britain</i>, a certificate

of <i>Newfoundland</i>, that the master of such
vessel had produced to him a certificate,

of the customs at the port from
whence such vessel was cleared out, or if
cleared out from the islands of <i>Guernsey</i>,

the governor, or deputy governor, and principal
officer of the customs there, testifying
that such vessel was duly qualified to
proceed on such fishery in pursuance of the
before recited act, made in the tenth and
eleventh years of the reign of King <i>William</i>
the third; and that it has been made
to appear to his satisfaction, by a certificate
under the hand and seal of the naval officer
of the district in <i>Newfoundland</i> where such
fish was landed, or where there is no naval
officer, under the hand and seal of the
commander of any of his Majesty’s ships
stationed there, or of such officer as the
governor shall approve, specifying the time
of such vessel’s arrival in manner before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>
directed, that such vessel was intitled, by
the priority and time of her arrival, to one
or other of the bounties therein mentioned,
as the fact may be; and that the master and
mate of such vessel had made oath, before
such naval or other officer as aforesaid, that
the number of fish taken on the first trip
amounted to ten thousand at least by tale;
that he had made two trips at least, and that
all the fish on both trips were catched on
the banks of <i>Newfoundland</i> by the crew of
such vessel only; which certificate and oath
the said governor, and naval or other officer
as aforesaid, are hereby impowered and required
to grant and administer to the master
and mate of such vessel, without fee or
reward; and upon delivering up the said
certificate to such collector, the respective
bounties therein mentioned shall be paid by
such collector in such and the like manner,

are hired upon shares, or are to receive
wages; which facts are to be verified on
the oath of the master of the vessel, made

and if such vessels shall be cleared

or <i>Alderney</i>, then such oath shall be taken
before a magistrate of the royal court, in
the presence of the principal officer of the

to be given and affidavits taken in
<i>Newfoundland</i> as aforesaid, in order to

as to the facts to ground his certificate
thereupon, as herein-before directed, for
the payment of the said bounties, shall and

in each year, in order that he may perfectly
examine the documents, and thoroughly
investigate the same, so as to be able
clearly and justly to settle the times of the

vessels, and adjust the different
bounties, and to whom they are and ought
severally to be paid.</p>

aforesaid, That every master of a vessel,

granted, shall, before he shall receive the
same, or any part thereof, make oath before
the collector and comptroller, or other
chief officer at the port in <i>Great Britain</i>
where he shall arrive on his return from

that all the men belonging to his

act, made in the fifteenth year of the reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</a></span>
of his present Majesty, it is enacted, That
no hirer or employer shall pay or advance
to any seaman or fisherman, or either of
them, during the time he shall be in his
service, more than half the wages which
shall at any time be due to him: And
whereas, in the case of green men, the advance
of one half of the wages may not
always be sufficient to fit them out and
clothe them for the season; be it therefore
enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it
shall and may be lawful for the hirer or
employer of any such green men engaged
in the said fishery, to advance to any such
green man, during the time he shall be in
his service, a sum not exceeding five pounds,
ten shillings, although the same shall amount
to more than one half of the wages which
shall be due to him, provided a sum equal
to the then current price of a man’s passage
home, not exceeding forty shillings for

act, made in the fifteenth year of his present
Majesty’s reign, it is directed, That in case
any seaman or fisherman shall at any time
wilfully absent himself from his duty or

hirer or employer, or shall wilfully neglect

intent and meaning of his contract or agreement,
he shall, for every day he shall so
absent himself or neglect or refuse to work,
forfeit two days pay to such owner or employer:
And whereas the said penalties have
been found insufficient; be it therefore enacted,
That, where any such seaman or
fisherman shall so wilfully absent himself
from his duty or employ, without the
leave or consent of his hirer or employer,
or shall wilfully neglect or refuse to work,
for the space of one day, he shall, for every
day he shall so absent himself, or wilfully
neglect or refuse to work, forfeit any

<p><i>An act to enable his Majesty to make such

carrying on the fishery on the coasts of the

His Majesty,
by advice of

give such orders
to the
governor of
<i>Newfoundland</i>,
&amp;c. as shall be
deemed proper
to fulfil the
purposes of the
treaty of <i>Versailles</i>,
and
the declaration
to the <i>French</i>
King, above
recited.</div>

<p>Whereas, by the thirteenth article
of the treaty concluded at <i>Utrecht</i>
on the fourth day of <i>April</i>, new stile, in
the year of our Lord one thousand seven
hundred and thirteen, between her late
Majesty Queen <i>Anne</i> and the most Christian
King <i>Louis</i> the fourteenth, it was, among
other things, agreed, That the island called
<i>Newfoundland</i>, with the adjacent islands,
should, from that time forward, belong of
right wholly to <i>Britain</i>, and to that end
the town and fortress of <i>Placentia</i>, and
whatever other places in the said island
were in the possession of the <i>French</i>, should
be yielded and given up, within seven
months from the exchange of the ratification
of that treaty, or sooner if possible,
by the most Christian King, to those who
had a commission from the Queen of <i>Great
Britain</i> for that purpose; nor should the
most Christian King, his heirs or successors,
or any of their subjects, at any time thereafter,
lay claim to any right to the said
island and islands, or to any part of them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[lxxxv]</a></span>
moreover, it should not be lawful for the
subjects of <i>France</i> to fortify any place in
the said island of <i>Newfoundland</i>, or to erect
any buildings there, besides stages made of
boards, and huts necessary and useful for
drying of fish, or to resort to the said island
beyond the time necessary for fishing and
drying fish: That it should be allowed to
the subjects of <i>France</i> to catch fish, and to
dry them on land, on that part only, and
in none other besides that part of the
island of <i>Newfoundland</i>, which stretches
from the place called <i>Cape Bonavista</i>, to
the northern point of the said island, and
from thence running down by the western
side, and reaches as far as the place called
<i>Cape Riche</i>: And whereas, by the fifth article
of the treaty of peace, concluded at
<i>Paris</i> on the tenth day of <i>February</i> one
thousand seven hundred and sixty-three,
between his Majesty and the late most
Christian King <i>Louis</i> the fifteenth, and his
most Catholick Majesty, it was, among
other things, agreed, that the subjects of
<i>France</i> should have the liberty of fishing
and drying on a part of the coast of the
island of <i>Newfoundland</i>, such as is specified
in the thirteenth article of the treaty of
<i>Utrecht</i>, which article is confirmed and
renewed by the present treaty: And whereas,
by the fifth article of the definitive
treaty of peace, concluded at <i>Versailles</i>,
between his Majesty and the most Christian
King, on the third day of <i>September</i> one
thousand seven hundred and eighty-three,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[lxxxvi]</a></span>
it was, among other things, agreed, That
his Majesty, the King of <i>Great Britain</i>,
should be maintained in his right to the
island of <i>Newfoundland</i>, and to the adjacent
islands, as the whole were assured to him
by the thirteenth article of the treaty of
<i>Utrecht</i>, excepting the islands of <i>Saint Pierre</i>
and <i>Miquelon</i>, which were ceded in full
right, by the said treaty of the third day of
<i>September</i> one thousand seven hundred and
eighty-three, to his most Christian Majesty;
and that his Majesty, the most Christian
King, in order to prevent the quarrels
which had before then arisen between the
two nations of <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>, consented
to remove the right of fishing which
belonged to him in virtue of the aforesaid
article of the treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>, from <i>Cape
Bonavista</i> to <i>Cape Saint John</i>, situated on
the eastern coast of <i>Newfoundland</i>, in fifty
degrees north latitude, and his Majesty the
King of <i>Great Britain</i> consented, on his
part, that the fishery assigned to the subjects
of his most Christian Majesty, beginning
at the said <i>Cape Saint John</i>, passing to
the north, and descending by the western
coast of the island of <i>Newfoundland</i>, should
extend to the place called <i>Cape Rage</i>, situate
in forty-seven degrees and fifty minutes
latitude: The <i>French</i> fishermen should
enjoy the fishery which was assigned to them
by the said article, as they had the right to
enjoy that which was assigned to them by
the treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>: And whereas, by a
declaration delivered by his Majesty’s ambassador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[lxxxvii]</a></span>
extraordinary to his most Christian
Majesty, bearing date also on the said
third day of <i>September</i> one thousand seven
hundred and eighty-three, his Majesty engaged
not only to insure the execution of
the last-mentioned treaty with his known
good faith and punctuality, but to give all
possible efficacy to such principles as may
prevent dispute; and, that the fishermen
of the two nations may not give cause for
daily quarrels, was pleased to engage that
he would take the most positive measures
for preventing his subjects from interrupting
in any manner, by their competition,
the fishing of the <i>French</i>, during the temporary
exercise thereof which is granted
to them upon the coasts of the island of
<i>Newfoundland</i>, and that he would, for that
purpose, cause the permanent settlements
which should be formed there to be removed;
and that he would give orders
that the <i>French</i> fishermen should not be
incommoded in the cutting of wood necessary
for the repair of their scaffolds,
huts, and fishing boats; and that the thirteenth
article of the treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>, and
the method of carrying on the fishery which
had at all times been acknowledged, should
be the plan upon which the fishery should
be carried on there, and that it should not
be deviated from by either party, the
<i>French</i> fishermen building only their scaffolds,
confining themselves to the repair of
their fishing vessels, and not wintering
there; the subjects of his <i>Britannick</i> Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[lxxxviii]</a></span>
on their part, not molesting in any
manner the <i>French</i> fishermen during their
fishing, nor injuring their scaffolds during
their absence: And whereas it is expedient,
in conformity to the definitive treaty of
peace and the declaration aforesaid, that his
Majesty’s subjects should be prevented from
interrupting in any manner, by their competition,
the aforesaid fishery of the subjects
of his most Christian Majesty, during the
temporary exercise thereof which is granted
to them on the coast of <i>Newfoundland</i>; and
that all permanent establishments on that part
of the coast allotted to the <i>French</i> fishermen
should be removed; and that such fishermen
should be in no manner molested,
contrary to the tenor of the said treaty,
and the good faith thereof: In order,
therefore, that his Majesty may be the better
enabled to carry the said several treaties
and declarations into faithful and punctual
execution, and to make such regulations
as may be expedient, respecting the fishery,
in the manner herein-after mentioned, be
it enacted by the King’s most Excellent
Majesty, by and with the advice and consent
of the Lords spiritual and temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the
same, That it shall and may be lawful for

of <i>Newfoundland</i>, or to any officer
or officers on that station, as he or they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[lxxxix]</a></span>

His Majesty

<p>Whereas, by an act, passed in the

of the fishermen, sailors, and others employed
in the said fisheries, to the ports thereof,
at the end of the fishing season</i>, it was,
amongst other things, enacted, That all
disputes which should arise concerning the
wages of every and any such seaman or fisherman,
and all offences which should be committed
by every hirer or employer of such
seaman or fisherman against that act, should
and might be enquired of, heard, and determined;
and the penalties and forfeitures
thereby incurred should and might be recovered
in the court of session in the said
act mentioned, or in the court of vice admiralty
having jurisdiction in the island of

act, passed in the twenty-sixth year of the
reign of his present Majesty, intituled,
<i>An act to amend and render more effectual
the present laws now in force for encouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_c" id="Page_c">[c]</a></span>

so much of the said first-mentioned act, as

wages of any seaman or fisherman, or any
offence committed by any hirer or employer
of such seaman or fisherman, or any

their contracts or agreements, should be,
and the same was thereby repealed: And
whereas the provisions made by the said first-mentioned
act, for the administration of
justice in civil cases, are insufficient, and
it is highly expedient that a court of civil

property, and all trespasses against
the person, goods, or chattels, should be

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
